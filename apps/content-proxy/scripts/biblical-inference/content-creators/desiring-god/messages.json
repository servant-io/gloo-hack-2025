My Friendship with John MacArthur John Piper Oct 8, 2025 Why Faith Bears Fruit John Piper Oct 8, 2025 Faith That Fights John Piper Oct 7, 2025 Continue in What You Learned and Believed John Piper Oct 7, 2025 Faith That Works John Piper Oct 6, 2025 Work as Worship John Piper Oct 6, 2025 More by this author Arrow Topic: Biography The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. (Psalm 19:7–11) It is amazing the way two hearts can be knit together by a common taste for this honey and a common greediness for this treasure. John MacArthur loved the taste of the honey from heaven. He was greedy for the treasures of the word of God. Heaven’s Honey He told a group of us in 2007, “I have never ceased to be thrilled with the preparation to preach. I love to discover the truth of God.” He loved the quest. He embodied Psalm 111:2: “Great are the works of the Lord, studied by all who delight in them.” But more than the quest, he loved the treasure. It wasn’t just the seeking, but the finding. It could never be said of John MacArthur that he was “always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth” (2 Timothy 3:7). He loved the search. He loved the discovery. He loved the treasure. And perhaps most of all, he loved heralding the treasure he found. A shared joy is a doubled joy. Holding out the treasure to others with clarity and conviction caused his own heart to see its glory more clearly and to savor its value more intensely. So, he loved to preach. And he was good at it. He was so clear, so textual, so precise and zealous and authentic and authoritative and practical and relevant and anointed. God made John MacArthur an extraordinary preacher. At every level, I was drawn in. The quest, the discovery, the treasure, the heralding, the anointing — fifty years ago, this is what I wanted. John MacArthur was seven years older than I am. Fifty years ago, that seemed like a chasm. But admiration from the younger to the older grew into friendship. Common Taste The spark flashed in 1988, the year before he published The Gospel According to Jesus. John was dismayed that the evangelical tribe that had nurtured him and given him a deep love for the Bible could also give rise to a theology of conversion that said things like this: “You can receive Jesus as Savior and later make Jesus your Lord.” To this John wrote, “[Jesus] is Lord, and those who refuse him as Lord cannot use him as Savior. Everyone who receives him must surrender to his authority, for to say we receive Christ when in fact we reject his right to reign over us is utter absurdity” (210). “When two hearts value the same glory with a similar intensity, they cannot but be united.” I could scarcely put that book down. I found it totally compelling and relevant. So, in February of 1988, I celebrated the book in an article in the Baptist General Conference Standard. John told me later that the fact that James Boice and J.I. Packer would write forewords for the book, and that I would celebrate it so publicly, awakened him to the fact that his tribal connections had just enlarged. In a sense, to John’s amazement, he found a home in the stirrings of the Reformed resurgence. But for me personally, John’s gratefulness for my support in the Lordship Controversy was more significant than a common tribal identity. John befriended me. And he never stopped befriending me. I doubt that he liked everything I wrote, but when he really liked something, he called me. He called me when he read A Peculiar Glory, my defense of the trustworthiness of the Scriptures. He called me when he read Providence. And this is where it became clear: We have a deep, common taste for the honey of heaven. We share a greediness for the treasure that is more precious than gold. We love — we manifestly love — the Bible, the word of God. God opened our eyes to see “the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God” (2 Corinthians 4:4). We have seen this supernatural light in creation. We have seen it in Christ himself. We have seen it in the gospel. And we have seen it in the whole Bible. We have both been captured by the truth and beauty and worth of the peculiar glory of the word of God. We thrill to study it, to find its unsearchable riches, and to preach the beauty of what we see. How could we not be friends? How could our hearts not be knit together? That’s what the heart is: It is a valuing organ. When two hearts value the same glory with a similar intensity, they cannot but be united. Precious Friendship Three things have helped me realize why this friendship felt so precious to me even though it was nurtured with only occasional personal contacts. First, we both owe an incalculable debt to our fathers — and that debt was also owing to their fundamentalist, dispensational heritage, which neither John nor I would ever despise. Jack MacArthur lived from 1914 to 2005. Bill Piper lived from 1919 to 2007. Both were Baptists. Both received honorary doctorates from Bob Jones University. Both were traveling evangelists — my father all his life and Jack until he became a pastor. Both were intensely doctrinal and biblical in their preaching. Who can calculate the ripple effect of such lives in the lives of their sons? I personally have no doubt that something clicked between John and me in significant part because of this precious heritage. The second thing that gave a special luster to our friendship for me is the fact that John MacArthur and I were wired in our personalities quite differently. Many of you will remember the most vivid illustration of this. During a panel discussion between us, someone asked how we deal with discouragement. I gave the illustration of a season in my life where I was sitting and crying on the steps of a guest house. My wife asked me what was wrong, and I said, “I have no idea why I am so sad.” MacArthur looked at me like I was from another planet. And then he said, “I don’t have time to be discouraged. I just go on to the next thing that has to be done.” It was a wonderful learning moment for all the young pastors in the audience: Take heart. Not everybody is like John MacArthur. God will get you through. God uses discouraged pastors. But my point is here that those differences — and there were others — had the effect for me of throwing the value and beauty of our friendship into sharper relief. Finally, the third thing that intensified our friendship was that we were both never satisfied with words, arguments, ideas, or doctrines. It was in our DNA to push through words and through doctrines to reality. Words and doctrines describe reality. They are not reality. God is the reality. Christ is the reality. The honey of heaven that we tasted in the Bible was Christ. “Taste and see that the Lord is good” (Psalm 34:8). The greediness that we felt for the treasure of the word was a greediness for Christ — for “the unsearchable riches of Christ” (Ephesians 3:8). Contend for the Faith There will never cease to be battles to be fought for the cause of God and truth. John would want me to say to all of you who have breath, “Contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3). But that commitment alone was not the sweetness of our friendship. The sweetness of contending for truth was captured by John Owen in these words: When the evidence and necessity of the truth abides in us — when not the sense of the words only is in our heads, but the sense of the thing abides in our hearts — when we have communion with God in the doctrine we contend for — then shall we be garrisoned by the grace of God against all the assaults of men. (Works of John Owen, 2:69, emphasis added) That was the key. That was the most important thing. That was the sweetness: “communion with God in the doctrine we contend for.” When that’s the essence of a friendship — communion with God in doctrine — death doesn’t end it. Both of us still enjoy communion with God in Christ, and in that sense with each other. Thank you, Father, for the life and friendship of John MacArthur.

They are Hebrew poetry, written to be sung. Written by hearts moved by powerful emotions, written into verse designed to capture those emotions and convey them to others, even to later generations — even to us, three thousand years later. For Christians today, we have at least three ways of reading the Psalms. These are not options, but three ways to read every psalm: First, as original compositions: from a human author and for a first audience Second, in relation to Jesus: how Christ himself fulfills the deep longings in the Psalms, and how he himself, as man and Israelite, took these precious songs on his own lips Third, how these songs then relate to Jesus’s new-covenant people, his bride, his church We need to have all three of these perspectives in mind this morning, but I want to focus especially on the last one, the church — and not just the church in general, but you, my dear brothers and sisters in Sweden, and your churches. Could I be so bold as to address the Swedish church this morning? (Not the “state church,” but Christ-adoring, Bible-believing, born-again Christians.) Our orienting question is this: What would Psalm 8 have Swedish churches be? Worship His Majesty Psalm 8 casts a vision for the future. It not only rehearses some past fundamentals of our world, and not only marvels at God’s grace in the present, but Psalm 8 swells with hope for a coming future. And that’s not just a future for David and the original audience, but a future for us today, halfway through 2025. Psalm 8 gives us, as Christians — and you, as Swedish Christians — a vision for corporate life as a people who cherish God’s majesty. I love the word majesty. This is a psalm that celebrates the majesty of God. Majesty brings together both God’s greatness and his goodness, both his strength and his beauty. Majesty is not only a fitting term for mountain majesties but a particularly appropriate descriptor of God, who is, above all, “the Majestic One” (Isaiah 10:34). Majesty is emotive, or affective. It indicates greatness (in sight or sound) that is also wonderful — bigness that is beautiful, imposing size that is viewed with delight, imposing power received as attractive. Majesty calls attention to the greatness of God’s glory and the glory of his greatness. For God’s enemies, his greatness brings terror. But his friends declare his majesty. God’s majesty is first glimpsed in the world he made. This is God’s natural majesty. The last part of verse 1 says, You have set your glory above the heavens. That is, God’s majesty is above the majesty of the heavens. Their majesty declares his greater majesty. And so, David looks at those heavens in verse 3, apparently at night (no sun): When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place . . . Don’t miss that David looks. He observes. He takes the time to look up at night, and he pauses to see the glory overhead as the majesty of his God. He observes divine majesty, he meditates on it, he feels it deeply, and he crafts a poem, a song of praise, so others might see and feel and express God’s majesty. I want to be observant like this: observant of God’s world and observant in God’s word. As I look at the wonders of the world, I want to wonder at the God they reveal! I want to find the pace of life shaped by Psalm 8, rather than by the city and the pressures of modern life. Oh, how tragic it would be if I were awake to the glories of this world and blind to the one whose majesty far exceeds them. I love that verse 3 says “your heavens.” It’s not just “the heavens,” but your heavens. And they are “the work of your fingers” — that is, easy work (not just detailed). This world, in all its majesty and splendor — majestic mountains and waterfalls, splendid forests and oceans, with all their stunning detail and beauty — didn’t take any heavy lifting from God. He just used his fingers. Majestic as the great features of the creation are, our God is the majestic one. The majesty of mountains and oceans is as nothing compared to the majesty of the one who made them with his fingers and didn’t break a sweat doing it. People of His Majesty So, what would our majestic God, through Psalm 8, have our churches be? I have five charges for you, my dear brothers and sisters in Sweden, and for your churches. 1. Be a commending people. By commending, I mean a praising people. This is a psalm of praise. And the great refrain that begins and ends the psalm commends God and praises him. (The whole psalm is second-person praise to God.) O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! (verses 1, 9) To praise God’s name is to praise God himself. You cannot praise his name without praising him, though you could praise someone without knowing their name. But if you know his name, and praise his name, you praise him. What name emphasizes is that God has revealed himself to his people. He told his old-covenant people his name through Moses. And he has revealed his new-covenant name to his church in the name that is above every name: Jesus. And the Father of Jesus. And the Spirit of Jesus. To praise God — not just as generic God, but to praise him by name — is to receive and cherish his revelation of himself to us. The God of majesty whom we praise is not a God of our imagination or speculation or best intuition or reasoning. He is the one true God, who made the world and introduced himself to the world through his old-covenant people and has most fully revealed himself to us in Jesus. Just last month, before I knew I’d be coming to Sweden, I preached on Psalm 8 to the First Swedish Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The church’s name is now Bethlehem Baptist, but it was founded in 1871 as First Swedish Baptist, and that was its name until April 1945. When I preached Psalm 8 at the old First Swedish Baptist last month, I commended them for being a praising people. They sing. And because they sing, their ten-year-old daughter church in Saint Paul sings. Visitors often comment to me about how the people of Cities Church sing. Do you know what I say? “We got that from our mother, Mama Bethlehem. (And don’t you talk bad about our mama!)” And you are a people who sing praise to our majestic God. So Psalm 8 would say, “Abound still more.” Don’t lose your penchant for praise, but lean into it! Keep loosing those allegedly reserved Swedish tongues to praise our God, and with your loosed tongues commend each other. Being a praising people overflows. When we learn to praise our God, we find ourselves more ready to praise and encourage each other. God is not threatened by Christians praising each other for evidences of his grace. He is very secure. He delights in our vertical praise and smiles at our horizontal praise as we see good in our fellows and commend it. 2. Be a called people. By called here, I don’t have in mind the call of conversion, but the call of vocation. Psalm 8:6–8 says, You have given [man] dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea. Now, what does that sound like? Beasts, birds, fish? Any other passage? This is an echo of Genesis 1:28. Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth. The first sense of call in Psalm 8 is to the original commission God gave humanity at creation. Sometimes we call this “the cultural mandate.” Being in God’s image, as his representatives, as his vice-regents over the created world, we humans are called to grow our number and expand our borders. We are to bring new humans into the world and raise them up, and venture out into new territory and bring order to the uncultivated, raw wilderness. And as humans increase and spread out across the earth, we learn to work together (be more fruitful) and find our specific abilities in the great calling. The aspirations of our hearts and abilities of our hands meet with tangible needs in the world to produce a God-given calling. “Psalm 8 gives us, as Christians, a vision for corporate life as a people who cherish God’s majesty.” So, a charge for us today from Psalm 8 is to be good at our God-given vocations. Trace them through Psalm 8, and back to Genesis 1, and under the providence of God. Your work this week and tomorrow morning really matters. Don’t just work for a paycheck; work with a divine purpose. See God’s sovereign significance in your work. I said this psalm carries in it an energizing hope for the future. As Christians, being called and having dominion brings into view not just the cultural mandate but the Great Commission. I really believe that a people can do both — that you can be both in Gothenburg and beyond. You can be excellent in local work and energetic in global mission. That doesn’t mean that our individual lives have to be portioned fifty-fifty. But as a church, we carry both of these callings together. We make our local labors excellent, and we go and send in the global cause of our majestic God. Healthy churches care for the global movement and for their own city. 3. Be a candid people. By candid, I mean honest, real, straightforward. Be honest about weakness, honest about smallness, and honest about sin. Another way to say it would be humble. Be humble, like David’s astounded question in verse 4. Remember, he has just marveled at God’s majesty in his heavens and his moon and his stars, and then he says, What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? The answer is not that man is great. The answer is that God is great, and man is the undeserving recipient of grace. God is strong — so infinitely strong that he doesn’t need to gather up the strong to reinforce his strength. Rather, he’s so strong that he gathers up the weak, shares his omnipotence with them, and shows himself strong through them. God Almighty doesn’t need our strength to shore up his or to fill in gaps in his strength. He puts his strength on display by making weak people his instruments and defeating seemingly strong foes. So, in verse 2, David says, Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger. Our God helps babies and infants, which means our God helps the weak. We are that! So, be candid. Be honest. You don’t have to play strong. When you have this God, you dare not. Own your weakness, confess it, and cry for help. Our cries for help connect us to the strength of God. (Second Chronicles 16:9 says, “The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him.”) Psalm 8 praises the God of majestic power who chooses to use the weak, not the strong — the little, not the big — and so turns our calculus for strength and worth upside down. Like Paul, we embrace weakness. We rejoice in suffering. We don’t despise the day of small things. We cherish God’s strength and glory — his majesty — on display in human weakness and disability and suffering. At the heart of Psalm 8 is not God’s natural, expected majesty, but his peculiar, unexpected majesty. He is not just majestic over the stunning heavens and beyond the great majesties of his creation, but he is all the more majestic in defeating his foes through empowering his weak people. He gives man, not angels, his dominion. Then, even more, he gives the weak, not the strong, his salvation. And you, Swedish church, are not only small and weak but also opposed. There are “foes” (plural), says verse 2, and there is a singular enemy and avenger. The church is often threatened, sometimes embattled — which leads to the next charge. 4. Be a conquering people. What I have in mind here is that strange last part of verse 8: “whatever passes along the paths of the seas.” Why this extra line? He already said fish. The loop is closed — beasts and birds and fish (and fish is plural). Then something singular lurks at the bottom of verse 8. Whatever seems like a good translation to me. Can you imagine how scary the sea was before people started pretending we knew what was down there? Elsewhere in the Psalms (74:14; 104:26), and twice in the book of Job (3:8; 41:1), and again in Isaiah 27:1, we hear about a creature called Leviathan, the fleeing, twisting serpent — the dragon that is in the sea. Remember, Psalm 8 is poetry. It’s a song of David. Songs often draw on imagery and don’t speak with the precision of epistles. But even if this line isn’t clear, our call to conquer as a people is clear enough. If it hints at Leviathan as the epitome and metaphorical embodiment of evil, then our call is clearly related to sin and evil: Defeat it. Tread on it. Put it under your feet. Don’t give the serpent any leash to slither around your garden. What is a Leviathan for you right now? Whatever it is, don’t make peace with it. Put the heel of your soul on the snake of temptation. But at this point, we might be missing the most important piece of the psalm, which is verse 5. As it stands, Psalm 8 is stuck. We’re to be a commending people, a called people, a candid people, and a conquering people, but there’s a glaring problem. Here’s how Hebrews 2:8 puts the problem, as he reads Psalm 8: We do not yet see everything in subjection to him. Psalm 8 echoes Genesis 1, but something has gone wrong with the world in the meantime, and something is not yet complete when David writes Psalm 8. God, in his peculiar majesty, has given humble man dominion over the works of his hands and put all things under his feet. But Hebrews says, “We do not yet see everything in subjection to him.” What’s the solution? Hebrews 2:9: But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. The vision of Psalm 8 was locked until Jesus opened it. So, we end with Jesus as the hinge that brings the majesty of Psalm 8 into our lives of weakness and hope. 5. You will be a crowned people. Crowned means you will be honored — with final, unending, unchanging honor. It’s an honor that only grows and sweetens forever. How so? After asking in verse 4, What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? verse 5 says, Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. Christ has come and fulfilled the destiny of humanity by going to the cross for us, rising again to new life, ascending to heaven, and sitting “down at the right hand of the Majesty on high” (Hebrews 1:3). Now Jesus, as man, is crowned with glory and honor. Jesus is crowned, right now. And he is building his church and beautifying his church. And his church, with her groom, will one day rise with him and ascend with him to the throne, and with him be crowned with glory and honor. And so, we, his church, are a Christ-adoring people. We commend him (and in him commend each other). We are called in our local vocations and commissioned in his global cause. We are candid about our smallness and weakness and sin and need. And we seek to fight back and conquer sin and evil, beginning in our own hearts. And we know that as Christ has been crowned, so we too, his people, will be crowned. And we will adore him and be luminaries of the majesty of God and the name of Jesus. David Mathis (@davidcmathis) is executive editor for Desiring God and pastor at Cities Church.

They teach us, in more than a hundred shapes and sizes, how to sing and how to pray. They model the inner life of genuine faith — the emotional life of a follower of Christ. They give us the mountains and valleys that come with trusting and following him. There are great mountains and great valleys that come for anyone who follows Christ. Psalm 86 is a valley psalm. It’s a desperate psalm — not a hopeless psalm, but a desperate one. It teaches us how to pray when trouble comes. Do you know how to pray when trouble comes? I don’t just mean, “Lord, help me,” or “Fix this” — but do you pray about trouble the way the Bible prays about trouble? I know I don’t always pray the way this psalm prays. Preparing for this sermon, I was reminded of a prayer we prayed before meals in our home growing up: “God is great, God is good, and we thank you for this food.” I have no idea where the prayer came from (maybe my parents made it up), and I don’t entirely understand it. “God is great, and God is good . . .” Isn’t great better than good? Maybe great means big, mighty, and awesome, and good means he’s for us? Whatever it means, I’m so thankful for those thirteen simple words. How many children grow up in homes where they never acknowledge that God has anything to do with the food on the table? How many children never hear their parents acknowledge God at all (except maybe to use his name in vain)? But I heard — PB&J after PB&J, spaghetti after spaghetti — “God is great, God is good, and he’s the one who gave us this food.” It was a good prayer for three-year-old, four-year-old, five-year-old heart and mind — and yet, if you and I had lunch this week, and I still prayed like that, there would be something off, right? Hopefully I’ve grown some in the ways I express my thankfulness for spaghetti. Hopefully I still grow in thanking him. I wonder if some of us are praying four-year-old prayers about trials. We haven’t learned how to pray grown-up prayers about the trouble in our lives (and we all have trouble of various kinds in our lives). We haven’t said, like the disciples, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). That’s my prayer for this morning: “Lord, teach us to pray — in this case, about the hard things in our lives.” Four Prayers for Any Trouble Before we try to learn how to pray about our trouble, we need to ask about the actual trouble here in Psalm 86. Why is David crying out to God like this? We don’t know a lot, and it takes a while before we really learn any details about his situation, but we do find out what’s going on near the end of the psalm. Look at verse 14: O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, and they do not set you before them. We have plenty of insolent men in our day, but we don’t call them that. Insolent men are rude men who don’t show respect for others (even the king). They’re troublemakers who stir up division and hostility. These horrible men are trying to kill the king. We don’t know who these particular insolent men were, and unfortunately there were so many insolent men who tried to kill David throughout his life that we can’t even guess which ones these might be. Can you imagine? I don’t think any of you have ever gone to bed knowing someone is driving around looking for you, trying to kill you. That was normal for David. He was in serious trouble here. And while our trouble is different from his, I believe God means for David’s trouble to teach us how to pray in our trouble, whatever trouble we face. I want to summarize the lessons in four simple prayers: Meet my need. Glorify your name. Teach me your way. Gladden my heart. Grown-up prayers don’t need to be long or complicated. There are precious lessons for us in these four simple prayers. 1. Meet My Need First, “Lord, meet my need.” David doesn’t mention the insolent men in the first verses, but he does start right off by praying for what he needs in the moment. Beginning in verse 1: Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. Preserve my life, for I am godly; save your servant, who trusts in you — you are my God. Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day. (verses 1–3) In other words, “Meet my immediate need. These guys are really trying to kill me, and I’m asking you to stoop down and intervene on my behalf. Do something about this, God. I know there are millions of people on earth, but I’m asking you to focus your infinite wisdom and strength to protect one of those millions from a few men.” When you think about what the Psalms are — these divinely inspired prayer-songs meant to be studied, memorized, and rehearsed for thousands of years — it’s kind of wild how specific some of them are. God clearly wanted us to hear godly saints pray for specifics. It’s one of the great gifts of the Psalms (and of all the prayers in the Bible). We get to hear real people pray about real stuff. God knew we would have our own specifics (and he knew that our specifics would be really different from theirs), and he wanted us to know how to pray for specifics. Do you still pray for the specifics in your life, even the little specifics? Philippians 4:6 says, Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. God wants us to pray for specific needs — large or small, anything and everything. If you’re anxious about something this morning — about anything — he wants you to pray about it. One way God accomplishes his God-sized plans for the world is to address you-sized needs in the world. We pray, “Lord, meet my need.” 2. Glorify Your Name The first prayer — “Meet my need” — is a real and good prayer. We pray for specifics, like when mad men are trying to kill us, or when the youngest child’s eye starts swelling suddenly. David really wants God to intervene in his actual human life and change something. “Meet my need!” That’s not the highest prayer in Psalm 86, though. And this is where our prayers start to grow up into fuller maturity. Let’s start in verse 6: Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace. In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me. (verses 6–7) He’s still asking for help. “Give ear . . . to my prayer” — meet my specific need. What does he say next? This is the second prayer: “Glorify your name.” Here’s how David prays it: There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours. All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. (verses 8–10) Why would he pray like that? “Lord, I need you to protect me from these bad guys. They’re trying to kill me, and I need you to stop them.” And then he prays, “There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours. All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name” (verses 8–9). Why does he pray like that? Why would he suddenly go from his particular need that day to the promise that all nations are going to worship this God? David prays like this because our confidence in asking God to do anything in our lives is rooted in his commitment to do all things for his glory. God will glorify his name — we see this all throughout the Bible, from beginning to end — and, amazingly, he chooses to glorify himself through showing kindness to us. He pours grace on undeserving people like me: grace to forgive me and save me from hell, grace to change me and empower me to live more like him, and grace to meet my very practical needs — to provide the food I need, and the home I need, and the job I need. God spreads his glory by loving his needy people. “One way God accomplishes his God-sized plans for the world is to address you-sized needs in the world.” And so, we don’t just pray, “God, deliver me from insolent men because you like to help people.” (He does.) No, we pray, like David, “Meet my need, because meeting my need will show the world what kind of God you are — that you are gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love; that you never abandon your children; that you own everything in the universe and will spend your infinite riches to care for us; that you have the power and authority to heal any illness and mend any relationship, no matter how hopeless it seems right now. How glorious will you look, God, if you do this! Glorify your name through my need.” This prayer — for God to glorify his name among all the nations — serves at least two great purposes in trouble. First, it grounds our hope that he might actually do something. He’ll care for us because that’s how he reveals his glory. But second, a prayer like this widens our eyes beyond our immediate need or heartache to remember what God is and will absolutely do in the world. “The nations you have made shall come and worship before you” (verse 9). That’s going to happen, no question — no matter what happens in my little circumstances here. And when that happens, all my little (or big) circumstances will be made right. “Oh man, things are hard right now — really hard — but I know what you’re doing in the universe. And I know no one can stop you. And when you do it, I won’t have to pray these prayers anymore.” Praying “Glorify your name” gets us out of the ruts of only praying about our needs. You’ve probably been here. I know I have been. Our prayer lives can become almost all about the job, the job, the job; the spouse, the spouse, the spouse; the child, the child, the child; the injury or sickness or weakness or conflict. Praying like David lifts us out of our need to see the bigger picture. God is glorifying his name all over the world, and one day soon all the nations will worship him. That doesn’t mean we don’t pray “Meet my need” prayers; it just puts those prayers into perspective. We pray, “God, meet my need for your glory.” 3. Teach Me Your Way Those aren’t the only two prayers in this psalm, though. When trouble comes to David, he prays, “Meet my need,” “Glorify your name,” and then, third, “Teach me your way.” Verse 11 says, Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name. “Let this trouble, this trial, be an opportunity for you to make me more holy — to refine away more of the remaining sin in my life. More than peace or relief from this trouble, I want greater godliness.” Notice that he says in verse 2, “Preserve my life, for I am godly.” He doesn’t think God is using this trouble mainly to confront him (we see that in other psalms). But even though he believes he’s doing the right things in this case, he wants to be even more like God. “God, use this trouble to sanctify me. Teach me your way, O Lord.” This is James 1: Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. (James 1:2–4) And don’t just teach me to do certain things (and avoid others). No, this prayer is much bolder than that. Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name. (Psalm 86:11) “I don’t just want you to help me do the right things (and not the bad things). I want you to change me somewhere deeper than my doing. I want you to change me inwardly. I want you to unite my heart toward you. I feel how distracted and divided my heart can be, and I want my whole heart to be united, aligned toward you. And I know that you often change me for the better inwardly through something hard out there.” Do you think that way when trouble comes? You get bad news of some kind. You feel hostility or opposition of some kind. Do you think, Oh, God’s about to make me more like God? I know I don’t always think that way. I think, I don’t like this. God, why this? Why now? Why this long? I’ve talked before about a bad leak we had in our kitchen late last summer. Well, that trial isn’t over yet, now more than nine months later. I won’t get into all of it, but it’s been a real trial. I call it a “small-t trial” because we’re praying for some of you who are going through far worse. But it’s been a trial. And in my low moments, I haven’t had a Psalm 86 heart about it. I’ve had a can’t-this-just-be-over attitude. We’ve wrestled with God. Reading these verses again these last couple weeks, as the back-and-forth with the contractor took another bad turn, was so good for my soul. “O Lord, this is getting worse again; you must be about to make me more like you. Lord, deliver us from bad actors, for we are godly. We’re doing all we can to deal with this in a way that honors you. But we’re not content to be delivered. We want to be sanctified. We want the fire of this trial to burn off more of our sin, and to prove and fortify whatever in us pleases you. Teach us your way, O Lord.” “And,” at least in this psalm, “we want you to make us more like you in one way in particular.” This brings us to the fourth and final prayer. This one’s the most surprising to me. 4. Gladden My Soul I really want you to see this fourth prayer. We’ll start again in verse 3: Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day. Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. (verses 3–4) Do you pray like this when trouble comes? Not just, “Get me through this” but “God, make me happier in you, even now, even here. Gladden my heart in this darkness, this valley. Give me reasons to rejoice in you, reasons bigger than all the pain and uncertainty I’m experiencing right now.” I want to have faith like David’s. It was so dark in his life at this moment that he couldn’t see around the corner — he wasn’t sure if he would survive — and yet he could see enough to enjoy God. This reminds me of the Christians in 1 Peter 1, who were being grieved by various trials, and yet Peter writes, “Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory” (1 Peter 1:8). All David can see is hostility and deceit and loneliness, and yet his joy doesn’t rest on what he can see. It rests on what he can’t see, because he knows he can’t see the most important things, the most precious things. His treasure is in heaven. His citizenship is in heaven. His hope is in heaven. And so, his valleys, even his darkest valleys, hold a joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory. The world can’t explain this kind of joy — in David or in you. And it’s here that we remember that David is not only teaching us to pray here in Psalm 86, but he’s also teaching us to sing. The Psalms were not written merely to be read and recited. No, they were written and memorized to be sung. As we walk through some especially dark psalms, it’s good to be reminded that these are songs. This is worship. Is there anything more Christian than singing through suffering? God is teaching us to bear what we have to bear by lifting our voices in praise — because songs like these say more about reality than our eyes ever could. Our eyes betray us, but the Psalms never betray us. We always have a reason to sing about who God is for us and what he’s done for us, and that’s where I want to close. You Have Delivered My Soul As we prepare to baptize two people now, they’re coming to declare that God has delivered them. He hasn’t delivered them from pain and suffering yet. In fact, they may experience more trouble because they’ve chosen to follow Jesus. Many do experience more trouble. Maybe you have suffered more trouble in your family, your neighborhood, or your workplace because you’re a Christian. Jesus says, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” (Matthew 16:24). These two haven’t been delivered from all trouble, but they have been saved from the worst trouble. And David prays that way right here in Psalm 86:12–13: I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever. For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. “I might die, but I’m not going to die — because you have already delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol, from that awful prison called death. I’m still suffering for now, but you’ve already delivered me.” How much more boldly can we sing this now, in Christ? This is Hebrews 2:14–15: Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. And how did he destroy the one who has the power of death and deliver those who were enslaved to the fear of death? By dying at the hands of insolent men. And bore it not with groaning but with gladness. “For the joy that was set before him [he] endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2). In other words, when insolent men came to arrest him, abuse him, and crucify him, the Father gladdened the heart of his servant. He took the cross for you, with joy. And if he could bear that trial with joy in the Father, surely I can bear my small-t trials with greater joy in him. Marshall Segal (@marshallsegal) serves as President & CEO of Desiring God.

So, unhappiness in America, according to this survey, has skyrocketed in the last twenty years. Now, that’s perhaps good news because that survey did not mean that, twenty years ago, millions of people found deep, sweet, soul-satisfying happiness in God, and now they don’t. That’s not what the survey meant. The survey was not inquiring about happiness in God. What the survey meant was that, twenty years ago, millions of people found some happiness in this world, in things of the world, and today they find less. And that may be good, because if you find less happiness in the world, which you desperately want more of, you just might turn to God. For the last 57 years, I have devoted most of my time to ransacking the Bible and human experience to understand the relationship between human happiness and the glory of God. And the upshot of that we now call Christian Hedonism. So, we’re going to look at definitions and foundations of Christian Hedonism, both vertical and horizontal. That’s where we’re going. Devoted to Pleasure Hedonism, in my 1963 Webster’s dictionary, is “a life devoted to pleasure.” I buy it. That’s what I mean by it. “A life devoted to pleasure” is what I mean by hedonism. Christian Hedonism is a life devoted to the fullest and longest pleasure — namely, pleasure in God. And I say that because of Psalm 16:11, which says, “In your presence [God] there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.” I’ve stood before many audiences and said this without the slightest fear that it would happen: “If anybody in this audience, after this session, can show me a better happiness than I have in God, I will cease to be a Christian. I’ll stop believing, and I’ll go your way.” But it is not only unlikely that you will do that; it is inconceivable that you would be able to do that — because there isn’t anything fuller than full or longer than forever. I’m safe. This is serious. This is really awesome. If you are banking on a pleasure that’s less than full and less than forever, you’re crazy. Tony’s whole message was saying, “Don’t do that!” The world is screaming at you, “Look at me! I made everything, and it’s glorious. Don’t waste your life!” That’s my definition of Christian Hedonism: It’s a life devoted to the fullest and longest pleasure — namely, pleasure in God. Now, what do I mean by vertical Christian Hedonism? I mean this: God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. Here I am below, and God is above. God is in pursuit of his glory, and I’m in pursuit of my happiness. And Christian Hedonism discovers in the Bible that he is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him. I’m home. My quest is over. His glory is magnified. My soul is satisfied. It is over. Horizontal Christian Hedonism relates to people. In about 1977, I was still at Bethel, and I was wrestling in those formative years and trying to think about how this vertical reality doesn’t leave me like a cross-legged Buddhist, saying, “Let the world go to hell. I don’t care. Me and God are good.” If that were the case, if this vertical reality doesn’t somehow release horizontal love for people, I know it must be false — because the Bible is so shot through with love as the aim of God’s commandments. Love fulfills the whole law. If your vertical hedonism is going to turn you into a recluse, where just you and God are super happy, it can’t be true. It can’t be biblical. So, over the years, I began to see how it works from the Bible. Here’s the way I put it: Vertical satisfaction in God expands by including others in it, even if it costs us our lives. I’m going to give you texts for that. I didn’t make it up. It will come straight out of 2 Corinthians, and you’ll see it with your eyes. I’ll give you a text on vertical Christian Hedonism and a text on horizontal Christian Hedonism, and that will fill up our time. By expand in the definition of horizontal Christian Hedonism, I mean that my joy in God gets bigger when I step out of my comfort zone of earthly satisfaction and am willing to lay down my life to include your happiness in my happiness, so that your happiness in God becomes my happiness in God, and mine is bigger because of it. That means, if I’m a Christian Hedonist — devoted to a life of pleasure — I’m going to lay down my life for you. And if I don’t, if I’m not willing to embrace the pain of love, I’m a fake. It’s just me and God, and I’m a fake. So, horizontal Christian Hedonism really matters. The Bible presents love as the litmus test. If you don’t love people, you don’t know God (1 John 4:20). Necessary Pursuit Here’s one more consideration before we go to the texts. The radical pursuit of joy in God is a Christian duty. One of my little books is called The Dangerous Duty of Delight. To the extent that we try to abandon the pursuit of our own pleasure — which is what so many ethicists tell you to do — you will fail to glorify God, and you will fail to love people. That is a crazy, radical statement: If you try to abandon your pursuit of pleasure in God, you can’t worship, and you can’t do anything right. Here’s a positive way to put it: The pursuit of pleasure in God is a necessary part of all worship and virtue. Worship becomes defective and virtue becomes defective to the degree that you are not pursuing and finding your pleasure in God. Just see what happens on Sunday morning if you tell people to do what they do out of duty instead of delight. It ruins the whole thing. And it’s the same thing when you visit someone in the hospital and say to the poor person who’s in the bed, “I didn’t really want to come, but I had to because I’m a pastor.” See how that goes down, in terms of creating a sense of being loved. But if I say to her, “I’m here because, frankly, though I wanted to be playing with my kids, to drive here and to be the instrument of your happiness in God makes me glad.” I’ve seen it in their faces. They think, I’m glad that your being here to help me makes you glad. That’s real love. The Only Life Worth Living The apostle Paul says, It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed. Those are very similar words, right? It’s a hope-filled expectation, an expectant hope. He’s saying, “This is what I want to happen in my life.” This is why texts like this grab me. I want my life to count. I want to do what the Bible says really matters. And that’s what this is. It is my eager expectation and hope that I will [negatively] not be at all ashamed, but that [positively] with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. (Philippians 1:20) My passion, my expectation, my hope, is that whatever I do with this body — whether I’m eating, or sleeping, or speaking, or running — Christ would be made to look magnificent. Is that a fair paraphrase? The word “magnified” is megalynthēsetai. Christ is magnified, made to look magnificent in your life. That’s why you’re on the planet, that’s why clouds are on the planet, that’s why the sun is on the planet, and all the creation that Tony talked about. It’s screaming, “He’s magnificent!” And that’s what your life is for. Paul said that was what he wanted to happen: “My eager expectation and hope is that Christ will be magnified.” I spent 57 years trying to ransack the Bible to understand the relationship between the glory of God and the happiness of man. And now I have the glory piece right here in front of me. This is glory. We could say that Christ would be glorified or shown to be glorious. So, if that’s what he’s saying, will he give me a clue as the text unfolds as to how that happens? And he does. Christ Magnified in Death Paul continues, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. (Philippians 1:20) In other words, I want to live in such a way that, in my life, Christ looks magnificent — and if I die, I want to die in such a way that, in my dying, I also make him look magnificent. That’s what he’s saying. Then comes the very important word for, which is a support for what he just said. He’s going to give an explanatory ground and show why Christ would be magnified whether he lives or dies. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. (Philippians 1:21) That’s his argument so far. And so far, it doesn’t work. It doesn’t hang together. Try to state the premises of the argument to yourself (because this is an argument). “My expectation and longing is that Christ would be magnified in my body in the way I die, because to die is gain.” That doesn’t make any sense. There’s a missing premise. You have to have another premise to make that work. You can say, “My death is gain because I’m so depressed that I just want to be out of here.” Seriously, to call death gain is not to magnify Jesus. There are all kinds of reasons why people call death gain, and they don’t magnify Jesus. This is not an argument that’s going to work — yet. He’s not done. You have to keep reading to make things work in the Bible. “Christ is made to look great in my ministry if my ministry is a means of making other people boast in Jesus.” But let’s be sure we see that he has continued to pick up on “by life” and “by death” by saying, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” He’s clearly thinking this through. He’s saying, “I want Christ to be magnified by my life, and I want Christ to be magnified by my death. The reason that he is going to be magnified by my life is that to live is Christ, and the reason Christ is going to be magnified in my death is that to die is gain.” Dying as gain will make much of Jesus, if there is another premise. So, let’s read the premise. Paul continues, If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me [that’s the life part]. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart [to die] and be with Christ, for that is far better. (Philippians 1:22–23) He wants to depart because he will have greater intimacy with Jesus, and that is far better. That’s the premise that was missing. Here’s how the argument works: “My expectation and hope, my longing for my life, is that Christ will be shown to be magnificent in my death, because to die is gain — because I get Jesus.” Now the argument works. And my Christian Hedonism just blew up with glorious manifestation. Can you put it together? Could you finish this talk? If you gave it enough thought, you could. You could put this together. That’s what we do with the Bible. We think. We meditate. Blessed is the man who . . . delight[s] . . . in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. (Psalm 1:1–3) Christ is going to be shown to be magnificent by death, and the reason is that this death of mine is experienced by me as gain. And the reason it is experienced by me as gain is because to be with Christ is far better. In my moment of death, if I am so satisfied in Christ — so restful in Christ, so trustful in Christ, so treasuring Christ — that everything I’m leaving behind is loss and he is gain, I make him look good. That’s my Christian Hedonism. I’m an old man. I pray a lot that this will happen. Satan hates me and he hates you, and in those last hours he will shoot at you with every arrow he has to make you doubt your life. He’ll tempt you to think, “It was all for the books. It was all for the pride of standing in front of people and talking about interesting things. You were on an ego trip all your life. You are one big fake.” How in the world will that make Jesus look good? So, this is serious stuff for me, and if you’re young, I hope you spend the rest of your life getting ready for this. We’ll talk about living for Christ, but the way you make Christ look glorious as you die is to treasure him more than you treasure what you leave behind. That’s the only way, which means that if you cease to pursue your pleasure in him, you cannot make him look good. Christ Magnified in Life That’s the first half of the argument — the death half. Now, what about the life half? It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body . . . by life or by death. (Philippians 1:20–21) Nobody is going to die while I’m talking, probably. Therefore, you probably have some more hours to live tonight. This is what you should be thinking about: How can you make him look magnificent in your life before you go to sleep tonight? That’s what you’re here for. It has to do with your tone of voice to your spouse in the car. It has to do with whether you are afraid when you walk through the neighborhood. It has to do with whether you are kind to the person on the corner. There are a million things that flow out of sweet restfulness in Jesus. You want to know how to make Christ look magnificent in your life, and Paul says, “To live is Christ.” That’s not a clear sentence. I don’t know what he means when he says, “To live is Christ.” Can you unpack that for me? It sounds great. I grew up on this. But what does it mean? It means, first, “If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me” (Philippians 1:22). That’s his first way of describing it — doing things that bear fruit. It’s not entirely clear what that means yet, but it gets us a little further along. Now, the rest of this is devoted to death, so let’s go to the next paragraph. Paul says, But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. (Philippians 1:24) Are we back to duty now? It’s about something on their account. His fruitful labor has to do with the Philippians. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all. (Philippians 1:25) That’s likely why Paul got out of prison in Rome and made one more visit to the Philippians. I take seriously his statement: I know. He’s thinking of traveling hundreds of miles with a death sentence probably hanging over him. But he senses that, somehow, it’s going to happen. And what will happen when it does? . . . for your progress [advancement] and joy in the faith. (Philippians 1:25) Paul is going to stay on the planet, Christ is going to be his life, and that will be fruitful labor toward the Philippians, which means that when he comes to minister the word of God among them, their faith will take off, and their joy of faith will swell. This is starting to get interesting. So, Paul, you’re saying that what makes Christ look magnificent by your staying is that your staying becomes the means of their happiness in Jesus? Yes, that is what he’s saying. Then he says, . . . so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. (Philippians 1:26) One Great Boast Let’s sum it up and see if you arrive at the same place I do. Paul said what he longs for in his life above all things is that Christ would be magnified in his bodily life, by his life. He wants Christ to look magnificent by everything he does while he’s alive. That’s going to happen, he says, because “to live is Christ.” And then he unpacks it. “To live is Christ” means that Paul will stay on earth to engage in fruitful labor. And what will be the fruit that will make Christ look magnificent? Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith. (Philippians 1:25) And that will also issue forth in boasting in Christ (Philippians 1:26). This word “boasting” (kauchēma) is sometimes translated as “rejoicing in,” or “boasting in,” or “exulting in.” What does that mean? If you boast in Jesus, what are you doing? What are you saying? What would be a sentence for your boasting in Jesus? “I make much of you.” Or maybe, “You’re really strong. You’re really strong. You’re really wise.” When you boast in your kids when they make a great shot in basketball, you say, “Did you see that shot? That’s my kid!” Boasting means seeing somebody’s quality and saying, “That’s great! I love that.” And that’s what we do if we are full of joy in him. The joy is simply the emotional explosion of the boast, which means we’re back to God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. Or we could say, “Christ is made to look great in my ministry if my ministry is a means of making other people boast in Jesus.” Just to underline that, listen to what Paul says in Philippians 3:7–8: Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ. By comparison to Jesus, everything is rubbish. That’s a pretty strong act of treasuring Jesus. It’s a very emotional act, because you have a lot of emotional things going on in the loss of all things — your marriage, your health, your house, your books, your car, your reputation. What happens if you lose it all and have Jesus? Gain. In summary, Christ is most magnified in us when we are more satisfied in him than what we lose in death and what we have in life. Here’s another summary statement: The key to magnifying Christ in life and in death is to find him more precious (more valuable, more satisfying, more joyful, more boast-worthy) than everything we lose in death and everything we have in life. That’s vertical Christian Hedonism. Joy’s Overflow Briefly, on horizontal Christian Hedonism, what does our joy in Christ have to do with our love for people? Paul says, We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia. (2 Corinthians 8:1) He’s writing to the Corinthians, and he’s using the Macedonians — that’s the Philippians and the Thessalonians — as an example that the Corinthians should copy. Now, what does that grace look like? When grace came down, and they tasted the grace of God forgiving their sins, giving them the hope of eternal life, and reconciling them to God, what happened? For in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. . . . I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. (2 Corinthians 8:2, 8) Paul is saying that love is the name he gives to what happened in the first two verses. He is proving, by the earnestness of others, that the Corinthians’ love is what he has just been talking about. Now, here’s the connection between love and joy in God. This grace of God produced an abundance of joy, and that abundance of joy was not in the absence of affliction but in the increase of it. That abundance of joy was not in the absence of poverty but in extreme poverty, which means that this joy — which is so abundant that it overflows — was not in anything that is on the planet; it was in the grace of God. They were thinking, “I’m saved! My sins are forgiven. I have the hope of eternal life. Everything is going to work together for my good. God is going to work all things together for my good. How can I not dance for joy? Poverty — what difference does it make? Affliction — what difference does it make?” Almost nobody in this room feels that way, because we’re all so worldly. When a bad thing happens to me, I’m in God’s face. But Paul is just a crazy, radical Christian. And that’s what I want to be and what you want to be. We want to know the grace of God — to taste the love of God and the presence of God — so deeply that even though there is huge affliction and poverty that never seems to go away, our joy would be like the mountains. On Tuesday, we met as a Teaching Team, and we were talking about how silly Christian Hedonism could sound — happy, happy, happy, happy. “Those guys at Desiring God are so superficial. Don’t they know about the wars going on? Ukraine? Gaza? There’s death everywhere.” And we were so thankful that for thirty years God has not let us be silly, and it’s because the Bible won’t let you be silly. It will not let you talk about any other joy than the joy that exists in affliction, or the joy that exists in poverty. If you don’t have joy that abounds in affliction and abounds in poverty, you don’t have Christian joy. This is serious. You could see why we would devote our lives to this for thirty years. It’s bottomless, like an ocean with no bottom and no shore. My conclusion is that vertical Christian Hedonism — which is happening in the connection we have with the grace of God and our abundance of joy (2 Corinthians 8:1–2) — overflows into horizontal Christian Hedonism. I couldn’t have asked for a text that says it any better. This abundance of joy in God now overflows in a wealth of generosity on their part, which is why I said that if I’m not willing to lay down my life to bring you into the joy I have in God, I’m a fake. If it does not overflow in generosity, if I just have to clutch onto my stuff, I’m just loveless. So, what is love? Love is the overflow of joy in God that meets the needs of others. But I want to put a twist on it, because that sounds like it’s just effortless and there’s no intentionality involved. I’m going to say that joy in God contains the impulse to expand and include others in it, whatever the cost. I don’t just stand here and say, “Wow, God, you’re great and you’re really wonderful,” and not do anything in the neighborhood and at church. That’s not Christian joy. There is an impulse coming from our joy in God to move outward. It was there in the Trinity, and it had to expand and spill over into Psalm 148. And our joy is like that too. Try feeling complete joy in God and ignoring people. You cannot do it. You know immediately that you’re a fake. That’s not joy in God; it’s a caffeine high. Our joy overflows, whatever the cost. Delight Yourself in God In conclusion, to the extent that we try to abandon our pursuit of pleasure, we will fail to glorify God (vertical Christian Hedonism), and we will fail to love people (horizontal Christian Hedonism). If there isn’t an overflow to bless other people with our generosity, then it’s fake. Pursuing our pleasure in God is a necessary part of all worship and all virtue. Therefore, “Delight yourself in the Lord” (Psalm 37:4). “Rejoice in the Lord always” (Philippians 4:4). These are commands. You don’t get any negotiation here. This is a command like, “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13 KJV). If you’re not delighting in the Lord, you’re disobeying God, and you need to be on your face tonight before God, saying, “Restore to me the joy of your salvation” (Psalm 51:12). I assume David prayed that often. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. (2 Corinthians 9:7) If you are giving generously with no joy in it or in the expansion of joy into others, you’re only halfway there.

The Strength of Godward Joy John Piper Oct 3, 2025 From the Solar System to the Soul John Piper Oct 2, 2025 The Evil That Stuns Heaven John Piper Oct 2, 2025 Humbled Yet Held: Simeon’s Secret Strength John Piper Oct 1, 2025 Snatching Women and Stumbling to Ruin John Piper Sep 30, 2025 A Mind Captive to Every Word John Piper Sep 30, 2025 More by this author Arrow Topic: Education Subscribe Apple Podcasts Spotify It is stunning that the most well-known and well-respected catechism in the Reformed tradition of Christianity, of which I consider myself a happy part, begins by asserting the eternal ultimacy of the human emotion of enjoyment. The Westminster Catechism begins with the question, “What is man’s chief end?” Chief end. Not secondary, not proximate, not subordinate. Chief. Final. Ultimate. And the catechism answers, “Man’s chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” Not trust him forever. Enjoy him. Not fear him forever. Enjoy him. Not obey him forever. Enjoy him. Not worship him forever, or praise him, or adore him, but enjoy him. Perhaps this is because, in the mind of those seventeenth-century divines, enjoyment of God is the essential component of all those other heart acts, so they went straight to the heart of the matter. Perhaps. “I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy” (Psalm 43:4). “In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore” (Psalm 16:11). “Delight yourself in the Lord” (Psalm 37:4). “Be glad in the Lord” (Psalm 32:11). “Rejoice in the Lord” (Philippians 3:1). Perhaps they saw these commands as the very marrow of the greatest commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30). The chief of all human experiences is enjoyment. Joy in the Puritans This is stunning for at least three reasons. First, if those seventeenth-century Puritan theologians were right (and I think they were, and I will try to show why), and if man is the chief actor under God in the theater of creation (and I think he is), then they are saying that, alongside the glorification of God, the human emotion of enjoyment — the enjoyment of God — is the chief reason that all of creation exists. Stunning. They are elevating the reality of human emotion to a place of supreme significance and importance alongside the glorification of God. It’s not a caboose at the end of the train of faith. It’s not peripheral to what makes a person a Christian — or a human. It’s not dispensable icing on the cake of commitment. It’s not secondary to faith or obedience or hope or love. Of all the acts of the human heart, of all the kinds of experiences of which the soul is capable, the Westminster Catechism chose enjoyment as chief of them all: an emotion, a feeling, an affection — pleasure, gladness, delight — chief of every human experience! Stunning. The second reason the catechism is stunning is that it doesn’t show us how to understand the relationship between the glorification of God and the enjoyment of God, except in one way: It describes them as one end, not two. The question is not, “What are the chief ends of man?” The question is, “What is the chief end of man?” And it answers (in the singular, not the plural), “Man’s chief end [not ends] is to glorify God and enjoy him forever” — which leaves us thinking, They must believe that this is somehow a God-glorifying enjoyment of God, and a very enjoyable glorification of God — as though God’s glorification as the chief end of all things consists in the human enjoyment of God above all things. Perhaps. Stunning. The third reason this first question of the catechism is stunning is that, among many of those who love the Westminster Catechism, this reality of the ultimacy of the human emotion of enjoyment has not taken deep root or borne its proper fruit — not in worship, not in daily obedience, not in education. Why would this be? Some may think, That’s just a quirk of language in an old catechism. For others, their personality may be so governed by the intellectual life that their emotional life has atrophied; the primacy of emotion doesn’t fit. For others, the emotional excesses of revivalism and Pentecostalism make them resistant to the foregrounding of emotion — let alone making it supreme as the chief end of human existence. Faith of Our Forefathers But it’s not as though we don’t have forefathers of mighty intellect who gave the enjoyment of God chief prominence. Surely, we would all think of Augustine, the towering intellect in the history of Christianity whose Confessions virtually sings with the supreme importance of the enjoyment of God. How sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys which I had once feared to lose . . . ! You drove them from me, you who are the true, the sovereign joy. You drove them from me and took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure. (Confessions 9.1, emphasis added) And for my own personal formation over the last 57 years, another towering intellect — Jonathan Edwards — wrote, I should think myself in the way of my duty to raise the affections of my hearers as high as possibly I can, provided that they are affected with nothing but truth, and with affections that are not disagreeable to the nature of what they are affected with. (Works of Jonathan Edwards, 4:387) This brings us now to a turning point in this message. From here on, the questions I will try to answer are these: Is this elevation of the human emotion of enjoyment to the highest place, as the chief end of human existence, biblical? Is it true? Closely related, how is it related to the glorification of God — or, more specifically for the purposes of the theme of our conference, to the preeminence of Christ? And finally, how does this shape classical Christian education? That’s a very tall order, so this will be condensed. Enjoying and Glorifying God Let’s take the first two questions together. How is the enjoyment of God related to the glorification of God? And does that warrant the elevation of the enjoyment of God as the supreme end of human existence? “The enjoyment of God is the key to classical Christian learning.” Let’s stay with Jonathan Edwards for just a moment because, in my experience, no one has even come close to the help Edwards has provided to me in wrestling with these questions — and they have been the most central questions of my life for half a century. So, here is Edwards’s answer to the question of how the enjoyment of God relates to the glorification of God: God glorifies Himself toward the creatures also in two ways: (1) by appearing to . . . their understandings; (2) in communicating himself to their hearts, and [he glorifies himself] in their rejoicing and delighting in, and enjoying the manifestations which he makes of himself. . . . God is glorified not only by his glory’s being seen, but by its being rejoiced in, when those that see it delight in it: God is more glorified than if they only see it; his glory is then received by the whole soul, both by the understanding and by the heart. (Works, 13:495, emphasis added) That may be the most important paragraph I have ever read outside the Bible. I’ve often said, “Books don’t change people; paragraphs change people.” Well, that one did. And what I have tried to do for the last 57 years is observe, understand, evaluate, feel, apply, and express the reality of that paragraph. Being the mediocre, amateur poet that I am, it has seemed good to make it a couplet: God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. So, Edwards’s answer and my answer to the question of how the enjoyment of God relates to the glorification of God is that they are in significant measure one thing — in the sense that enjoying God is essential if you would consciously make him look glorious in your life. I am not saying that God will not be glorified if you turn from him and enjoy other things more. (Then his justice would be glorified in your damnation.) What Edwards and I are saying is this: If we do not enjoy God himself above all other things, we do not glorify him as we ought. To use a rhyme: Our greatest Treasure is made clear by what gives us most pleasure here. So, I am very happy to restate the answer to the first question of the catechism: “The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever.” If this is true — that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him — then the answer to our first question is yes, the catechism was right to elevate the human emotion of enjoyment as the chief end of human existence. The enjoyment of God is the final, ultimate goal of human existence. It is not a means to anything. Supreme enjoyment of one who is supremely enjoyable is not, and cannot be, calculating — as if the enjoyment of God were a performance to attain something beyond God. Joy is the end (the final goal) of human existence. “In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore” (Psalm 16:11). There is nothing fuller than fullness. There is nothing longer than forever. This is the final, everlasting end of human existence. And it is not only the best end, but also the best imaginable end. Counterintuitive Experience of Gladness So, is it true that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him? Is it biblical? Or, to put the focus specifically on God the Son, Jesus Christ: Is Christ most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him? Those are virtually the same question, because Jesus said, “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:9). And he prayed, Father . . . glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you. . . . I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. (John 17:1, 4–5) The first sentence on the webpage announcing this conference says, “Classical Christian education is ultimately about the glory of God through Christ.” The glory of God through Jesus Christ. That’s exactly right, because Jesus said, “Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him” (John 5:23). There is no glorification of God that is not a glorification of Christ. So, I ask again: Is it biblical that Christ is most magnified in us when we are most satisfied in him? Is Christ most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him? Jesus said in Matthew 10:37, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.” Some people are so resistant to this truth that they try to limit the reality of love for Jesus to acts of obedience. That is clearly not the way we love our children. But Jesus says we must love him more than we love our children. We love our children with strong affection. They are precious to us. And Jesus says, “I must be more precious to you than your children and your parents, or you’re not mine.” Why would that be? Because treasuring Christ above all is how we glorify Christ above all. The apostle Paul showed this truth in his own life. God gave him a thorn in the flesh to keep him from being conceited (2 Corinthians 12:7). Paul pleads three times that the thorn be taken away. Jesus responds, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). So, the grace of Jesus and the power of Jesus are going on display in Paul’s pain. How can that be? It will not happen if Paul is resentful, and angry, and bitter at the Lord Jesus for sending this thorn. That emotional condition of Paul’s heart would not reveal the beauty of Christ’s grace or the greatness of his power. How does it happen? How is the glory of Christ’s grace and power put on display? It happens by Paul’s heart response. He says in verse 9, “Therefore I will boast all the more gladly [hēdista, from which we get “hedonism”] of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” It is precisely the utterly counterintuitive experience of gladness in the all-sufficient grace and power of Christ that magnifies the worth of Jesus in Paul’s pain. The enjoyment of Jesus, and all that God is for Paul in him, is the essence of how Christ’s glory shines in his life. Therefore, I am arguing that it is thoroughly biblical, and therefore true, that Christ is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him, especially in our suffering. That God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. That it is right to paraphrase the catechism, “The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever.” It is right to elevate the human emotion of enjoyment — the enjoyment of God — to the highest place. It is the chief end of human existence. Key to Christian Learning Finally, we approach the question, “How does this shape classical Christian education?” I had lunch last week with Russ Gregg, who founded Hope Academy six blocks from our home, and who is on the board of the Society for Classical Learning. I asked him how he would describe a classical Christian education. The first thing he mentioned was the unapologetic aim of shaping the students’ character. Second, he mentioned a focus on goodness and beauty and truth. And third, he mentioned the preeminence of Christ as the origin, and substance, and goal of everything. Only then do we come to some of the distinctive subject matter. I’m going to focus in these last few minutes on how the elevation of the enjoyment of God to its supreme place shapes the formation of students’ character. One way to sum up character formation is that the power of sin is broken, and the goodness of love overflows. How, then, is the power of sin broken? And how does love overflow? The seven deadly sins are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, anger, and sloth. Every one of those is a heart craving, not just a mental state. They all involve the emotions. The craving has run rampant and is out of proportion with reality. Pride craves praise. Greed craves money. Lust craves sexual stimulation. Envy craves the failure of others. Gluttony craves food. Anger craves vengeance. Sloth craves ease. How shall these sins (cravings, emotions) be rooted out of our students? They must be born again, through the living and abiding word of God, the gospel. They must embrace Jesus as the Savior, Lord, and Treasure of their lives. They must taste the sweetness of forgiveness and a right standing with God through Christ and come into precious fellowship (friendship!) with the living God — into the enjoyment of God. How, then, does this sever the root of deadly sins? Augustine has already told us: How sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys which I had once feared to lose . . . ! You drove them from me, you who are the true, the sovereign joy. You drove them from me and took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure. The power of the pleasures of sin is broken by a superior pleasure. Christian character is formed by the preeminence of the enjoyment of God. Here’s the way Jesus said it: The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. (Matthew 13:44) The sinful bondage to everything in his life is broken by the superior pleasure in the newfound treasure. “In his joy” he sells everything. “I count everything as loss compared to the surpassing value of knowing King Jesus, my Lord” (see Philippians 3:8). This is what Thomas Chalmers called “the expulsive power of a new affection.” And that new affection is the enjoyment of God as the chief end of human existence. If that’s how the God-demeaning, people-destroying, deadly sins are broken, what about the God-exalting, people-serving power of love? How is that released? Here’s Paul’s answer in 2 Corinthians 8:2: In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy [in the grace of God, verse 1] and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity. In spite of affliction, in spite of poverty, their abundance of joy in God overflowed in generosity. Paul calls this “love” in verse 8. So, love is the overflow of the enjoyment of God that meets the needs of others. Love is the impulse in the enjoyment of God that expands to include others in it, even if it costs us our lives. I conclude, therefore, that the enjoyment of God is indeed rightly called the chief end of human existence not only because it is the essence, the marrow, of all God-glorifying acts, but also because it is the only way that the bondage of sin can be broken and the power of love unleashed. It is the key to all Christ-exalting character formation. And therefore, the enjoyment of God is the key to classical Christian learning.

In the last chapter, Jesus was ministering to a curious Pharisee — a teacher of the law, a ruler of the Jews, untouchable. And yet, Jesus reaches out to him and invites him in, answers his questions, and challenges his thinking, to draw him into the kingdom. This is a guy from the highest, most intellectual, most religious sphere of society. And then here, just a few verses later, he’s stopping to minister to a sexually immoral, socially alienated woman — untouchable. And yet, Jesus reaches out to her, engages her questions, and invites her to drink from his fountain of living water. These two couldn’t be more different. He’s a Jew, a leader in society, steeped in Scripture, rigorously observing the law. He’s a man and he comes at night, and we know his name: Nicodemus. She’s a Samaritan, and an outcast even in Samaria, in and out of relationships with men, far less familiar with God’s law. She’s a woman and they meet in broad scorching daylight; and we don’t even get her name. These two people couldn’t be more different — and I believe that’s utterly intentional. What do I take from it? It doesn’t matter who you are this morning — Jesus has something to say to you. It doesn’t matter if you’re a politician or a prostitute; a priest or a thief; a CEO, a stay-at-home mom, or a college student; a Jew, a Samaritan, or a lifelong Minnesotan — Jesus has something to say to you this morning: something convicting and something renewing, something hard and something really, really good. It was true with Nicodemus, and it’s true here with this woman, and it’ll be true here in this room — if we have ears to hear him. ‘Give Me a Drink’ We read here (John 4:1–3) that Jesus leaves Judea because of pressure from the Pharisees (they were getting jealous and angry), and so he heads for Galilee. You had to go through Samaria to get to Galilee. But Samaria was a bad word for Jews. Jews hated Samaritans, and Samaritans hated Jews. But he has to pass through Samaria to get to Galilee, and as he does, he gets tired from all the walking, so he finds a well where he can stop and get a drink. It’s the sixth hour (probably about noon), the hottest part of the day. No one draws water at noon in Samaria. They come earlier or later in the day, when it’s cooler. No one comes at this time. But while he’s there, a woman stops at the well — a “woman of Samaria.” So, this is Mrs. Bad Word. And as we’ll find out in a minute, she’s there at the well in the hottest part of the day for a reason. She is likely ashamed to be around the other women because of all the men she has been with. Despite all that, Jesus says to her, “Give me a drink” (verse 7). You can tell how surprising it was for him to even talk to her, because of how she responds in verse 9: “‘How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?’ (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)” No dealings. Not even a cup of water in the heat of the day. Why did Jews and Samaritans hate one another? In the beginning, the nation of Israel had twelve tribes, one each for the twelve sons of Jacob. And the capital of that nation was (and is) Jerusalem. Israel still had twelve tribes when Solomon was king, but when he died and his son Rehoboam took over, he ruled badly and alienated ten of the twelve tribes. Those ten split off in a mutiny against Jerusalem. They formed a new northern kingdom, and they made Jeroboam their king. That made them traitors in Jerusalem. And Samaria was the capital of this traitor nation. Foreigners moved into the northern kingdom, and they intermarried with the Jewish people, making the people less and less Jewish over time. Eventually, that mixed race was called Samaritans, after the capital city. For the Jews, it was synonymous with half-breed or impure. They despised Samaritans. One scholar writes, The ethnic and cultural boundary between the Jews and the Samaritans was every bit as rigid and hostile as the current boundary between Blacks and Whites in the most racist areas of the United States. (From Every People and Nation, 163) Imagine refusing someone something as small and critical as water simply because of their ethnicity. That’s how malicious this rivalry was. ‘Call Your Husband’ But Jesus isn’t offended. He answers, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water” (John 4:10). In other words, “You think you’ve got me figured out, that I’m like every other Jewish guy you’ve heard about, but you have no idea. If you knew who I was, you wouldn’t have waited for me to ask for a cup of water.” She’s confused, of course, so she says, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock” (verse 12). In other words, “This water has been just fine, and for hundreds of years. As far as wells go, this is a great well. Why would I need different water? (And besides, if you had better water, what would you even put it in?)” To which he replies, “Has this water really been enough for you? And if it has, why do you have to keep coming back here like you do?” Here’s how he says it: Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. (verses 13–14) What do we learn about this “living water”? When you drink it, you’ll never be thirsty again. It might be hard for us to feel what this would have meant in that day. We have clean water everywhere we turn, coming out of every faucet in our homes. In that day, they had to carry these buckets back and forth, back and forth — for drinking, for cooking, for bathing. Water was a huge part of their lives. And Jesus says, “If you drink from my well, you’ll never be thirsty again. You’ll never have to do this walk again.” But he goes even further than that. “The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (verse 14). When you drink this water, you’ll never thirst — and you’ll never die. You’re going to live forever. The woman still doesn’t totally get it, as we’ll see, but she’s heard enough to be sold: “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.” In other words, “Give me this eternal water service, gallons just showing up at my house every day. I don’t want to come out here over and over and over again. I hate coming out here in the heat of the day. Please give me some of this special water you’re telling me about.” “Jesus said to her, ‘Go, call your husband, and come here’” (verse 16). It seems straightforward enough. He says, “If you want what I’m offering, go grab your husband, and we’ll talk more.” It’s not straightforward, though, not at all — and Jesus knows that. “The woman answered him, ‘I have no husband’” (verse 17). It’s a little awkward, but not necessarily a problem (yet). But, again, Jesus, knows more than she thinks he does. “Jesus said to her, ‘You are right in saying, “I have no husband”; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true’” (verses 17–18). “You think your sins are too great, too bad, too many. This woman is in the Bible to tell you that’s not true.” So, we’re not really talking about water at all, are we? This isn’t about Jacob or buckets or water. Her well is men. She has been trying to quench her thirst for love, for security, for life, in the arms of romance. He asks her for a drink because he knows how thirsty she is. She’s dying of thirst inside, and she’s tried well after well after well — Greg, then Ryan, then Jared, then Dave, then Scott, then Tony. (Who knows what their names were?) And she is still so thirsty. She’s thirstier than she was before she met the first guy. Put Your Bucket Down Sin is the anti-well, the anti-fountain. And some of you are drinking there every day. Maybe you’re like this woman, and you’ve thrown yourself into relationship after relationship. Maybe your wells are online, in the dark places of the Internet. Maybe you’re fostering some bitterness or anger. Maybe it’s indulging in alcohol, or overeating, or binge-watching. The first time you put in your bucket, you got enough for a drink. And then a little less, and a little less, and a little less. Now you’re scraping the dirty bottom for a thimbleful, for a drip of water. But you’re so thirsty, so you keep trying. Put your bucket down. Whatever it is, put it down and walk away. Don’t drink there anymore! Come to the fountain of life, and you’ll never be thirsty again. All you have to do is ask. Did you hear that, in verse 10? “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” Why would he give it? Because you asked. All you have to do is ask! Right here in these verses is a well, a spring — and it will never fail you. You don’t even need your bucket anymore, because the well is inside of you. “The water that I will give him will become in him” — in you — “a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (John 4:14). Which Well Will You Choose? So, which well will you choose? What’s keeping you from asking? What’s between you and the fountain right now? In this story, Jesus overcomes three great hurdles, three great barriers, the kinds of barriers that might be keeping you from coming to the fountain. You could summarize them like this: six husbands, two temples, one wall. 1. No Sin Is Too Great Six husbands. (Well, it was five husbands and the boyfriend.) But six men wasn’t too many. It might have gotten her canceled in town (she had to go draw water by herself in the heat of the day), but six men didn’t disqualify her from this well. These six husbands tell us that no sin is too great. You know that, but I want you to know it. Some of you know it, but you don’t believe it. You don’t. You think your sins are too great, too bad, too many. This woman is in the Bible to tell you that’s not true. We don’t find out that she’s been with so many men until verse 18, but Jesus already knew in verse 1. He knew, and he still stopped to talk to her. He still offered her a drink. He offered her the only drink she’d ever need, the one that would quench and heal all the aching dryness inside of her. He wasn’t embarrassed to be seen with her. He wasn’t too ashamed of her to bear her sins and make her his own — if she would just ask. So, will you ask? Will you forsake all your other wells and drink from this fountain? Will you believe, repent, and be forgiven? 2. No Place Is Too Far Two temples. When Jesus already knows about all her husbands, she realizes he’s a prophet, and she turns the conversation to how and where to worship. John 4:19–20 says, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.” She’s bringing up an argument between Jews and Samaritans. When the northern kingdom split off from Judah and Jerusalem, they built their own temple on Mount Gerizim (that’s the mountain she mentions). The Jews in Jerusalem obviously didn’t think that temple was legit, though, and so that was another reason to hate each other. She realizes this conversation is not really about water, or even about her husbands; this is a conversation about worship. And worship happens, in her mind, in either this temple or that temple. Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. (verses 21–23) For hundreds and hundreds of years, God’s people worshiped in one big temple, a building — 150 feet tall and 1.5 million square feet. It’s big, a massive dot on Google Maps. But it’s one big dot. “Not anymore,” Jesus says. “Up until now — up until me — you had to come to a place, a temple, to offer right worship to God. Now you can worship him anywhere. You can worship him in St. Paul, Minnesota, in a country that won’t even exist for another couple thousand years.” What do these two temples tell us in the story? That now, no place is too far. The hour has come when “true worshipers worship the Father in spirit and truth” (verse 23). True worshipers worship in spirit — not just with our hands and knees and gifts, but by the work of the Spirit inside of us. This is what Jesus just told us in John 3:5: “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.” And true worshipers worship in truth — that is, they worship according to how God has revealed himself in his word and in the Word made flesh, his Son. Those are the essential ingredients: God’s supernatural work in you by the Spirit and God’s supernatural revelation in the Bible, most fundamentally in Jesus. And now, in Jesus, if you worship in spirit and truth, you can worship God anywhere. You don’t have to come to this building to worship Jesus. You should absolutely join a local church and faithfully attend its gatherings, but you can worship Jesus in the temple high on the mountain or down by a well in the heat of day, in the sanctuary on Sunday morning or alone in your bedroom on your knees. Because of Jesus, you can meet and worship God in any place. And one day soon, he will be worshiped in every place, when his glory covers the earth as the waters cover the sea (Habakkuk 2:14). No place is too far. 3. No Wall Is Too High The wall. Jesus calmed the raging storm with a word, and he brought down the mile-high racial-ethnic-religious wall between Jews and Samaritans with a drink of water (actually, with less than a drink of water, because as far as we know, he never got the drink). This raging hostility between Jews and Samaritans tells us no wall is too high. This Jesus overcomes every conceivable boundary and hostility between us. So, what walls seem too high today? Are they in the Middle East or Asia? Jesus had to pass through Samaria — and he has to pass through Iraq, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. He has to pass through Cameroon, the Philippines, and Turkey, where our global partners serve right now. Those are high, high walls. But no wall’s too high. Why does he have to pass through those hard places? “This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14). One day we will sing, “Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation” (Revelation 5:9). Do you want to reach an unreached people with the gospel, to help bring down walls around the world so that people dying of thirst might finally hear about Jesus? You won’t find a wall too high. Jesus can bring any wall down, and he can do it with a cup of water. How much more might he do through you? You won’t find a wall too high in the Middle East, and you won’t find a wall too high in Minneapolis, in your neighborhood, or in your family. These walls are a lot closer, so they might look and feel a lot higher, a lot thicker, or (in the case of family) a lot more sensitive and painful. How could God ever save him? Or her? But there’s no sin too great, no place too far, and no wall too high. Do you still believe that — even for them? The Father Is Seeking Worship And why is no sin too great, no place too far, and no wall too high? Because, as John 4:23 says, the Father is seeking people like us to worship him. “The hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.” Despite all the barriers, it’s going to happen. Why? Because the God of heaven is out looking for them. He’s meeting them at wells and in temples; he’s finding them at big Christian conferences and in conversations at the gas station; he’s using parents and neighbors and Little League coaches and roommates and coworkers — he’s seeking. He’s seeking worshipers. Does that sound selfish to you? “The Father is seeking worshipers.” If one of you talked that way, it would be gross, right? If I said, “Pastor Daniel is seeking worshipers who will worship him,” you’d say he shouldn’t be a pastor. We’d think he’d lost his mind. We don’t like people like this. So, why is it any different with God? Why can he do everything he does for his own glory? (And he does do everything he does for his glory.) And why can he tell us to do everything we do for his glory? “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31). Because he’s worthy of all the glory — more than we could ever give him, more than the sun and moon and stars and mountains could ever say — and because his glory is the best news in the world for people like us. Why do I find so much hope and comfort in his seeking worship? Because when this God finds a worshiper, he gives that person the spring of living water in him. Worship is our well of living water. And if God wasn’t seeking, we’d never find him. That’s how blinding sin is. This God reveals his glory by satisfying the dry and weary souls of the undeserving, of the sinful. I want a God like that. And he’s the only one there is. And this Father was so relentlessly committed to finding you, knowing you, saving you, that he sent his Son into the world to die for you. The woman says, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things” (John 4:25). And Jesus says to her (maybe the clearest, most shocking statement he makes about himself in all the Bible): “I who speak to you am he” (verse 26). And in that moment, she hears what we’ve known since verse 1: The normal-looking Jewish man standing by this well, at the heat of day, asking her for a drink, is the Savior of the world, the Son of God, the Messiah. One of the sneaky, startling things about this passage is hiding in verse 6. We read right over it: “So Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well.” Jesus was wearied. It should take our breath away that the Son of God was wearied. He didn’t “count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself” (Philippians 2:6–7). He got tired like we do and needed a drink like we do. He was willing to be wearied for you. And far more than wearied, “he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:8). This long, hot journey from Jerusalem to Galilee, through terrible hostility, is a picture of this whole Gospel, of the whole Bible. Jesus was wearied for you, betrayed for you, pierced for you, crushed for you, so that you might worship him in spirit and truth — and never be thirsty again. He’s still seeking. Will he find worship in you? Marshall Segal (@marshallsegal) serves as President & CEO of Desiring God. He’s the author of Not Yet Married: The Pursuit of Joy in Singleness & Dating.

Tony Reinke Apr 7, 2024 Ask Pastor John Tony Reinke Mar 1, 2024 More by this author Arrow Scripture: Psalm 148 Topic: Creation Subscribe Apple Podcasts Spotify Franz Kafka wrote some bizarre stuff, maybe none more bizarre than his short story The Metamorphosis. It’s built around a haunting premise: A young man, in his bedroom in his family’s home, goes to sleep one night and awakens as an “enormous pest,”1 a man-sized insect. We’re never given a precise description, but we read that he has a hard, armor-like back and spindly, pitifully thin legs that wave helplessly. It’s something like a giant beetle. The former man can no longer speak words; he now only lets out a “painful chirping” — a loud, high-pitched squeaking sound that’s unintelligible to his family. He continues to have lucid thoughts but cannot share them. He is, Kafka tells us, speechless — no longer in communication with humans. His horrified family slams his bedroom door in disgust. His father grows harsh. The pest hides inside his house and mostly in his bedroom. He becomes a burden to all. His sister brings him food and cleans his room at first, but that kindness ends over time. His tastes change. He grows repulsed by his favorite foods in favor of rotten scraps. His volition erodes. He ebbs into something subhuman. His room becomes his prison. He is isolated, neglected, frustrated, depressed, and then he expires. It is a claustrophobic horror story of the nightmare of transforming from a volitional creature to a non-volitional insect, cut off from humanity. And yet, as dark and dehumanizing as Kafka’s vision is, it introduces us to a very humanizing theme. My assignment tonight is to look at the joyful purpose of creation through the eyes of a Christian Hedonist. Specifically, for those of us who still want to be happy, how does all that God created relate to my own joy? This is the connection made in Psalm 148. Turn there, near the end of the book. The whole Psalter has been building into a praise crescendo, which is why Psalm 148 looks like a repetitive contemporary worship song with this “Praise the Lord” refrain. Here’s the outline. It’s a praise sandwich, with the bulk in the middle. Praising angels frame the beginning of the psalm, in verses 1–2. Worshiping people frame the conclusion of the psalm, in verses 11–14. Sandwiched in the middle is the praise of non-volitional creation — the praise of stars and planets and moons and weather and mountains and animals and insects (like beetles). And I want to ask: Why? Why this praise sandwich? Chorus from the Sky So, let us first ascend into the praise chorus from the sky. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts! (Psalm 148:1–2) The psalm starts high, encouraging the angels to praise God from high elevations. I don’t know that angels need to be reminded to praise — but if they need it, here’s the reminder. With that, we turn to the bulk of the psalm, which is the praise of non-volitional creation. This is the middle layer, but still high. Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you [billions of] shining stars! Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens! Let them praise the name of the Lord! For he commanded and they were created. And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away. (verses 3–6) Again, we’re still in the sky — angels to stars. From the farthest glittering star, way out in the black sky, God’s decree is behind all creation and all his providence. We praise God for his all-sovereign design and governance of all that he has made from nothing, by sheer command. Chorus from the Earth Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all deeps. (verse 7) Praise the Lord, whales and dolphins that explore oceanic deeps — secret canyons and ravines and underwater cliffs that most of us will never see. (There’s at least one scuba diver in the house.) Fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling his word! (verse 8) Fire from the sky is lightning. If you’ve read my latest tech book or heard my message on Job 36–37, you know that the whole digital, electrified age is gifted to us in this fire from the sky. Now, circle wind and word. It’s a play on words. Note the closeness of God in his creation. God speaks a commanding word, and his wind blows.2 And it’s not just wind but stormy wind. God speaks a commanding word, and storm winds blow. Praise the Lord, you thunderbolts and hailstorms and stormy winds that fulfill God’s will. God decreed you to be, and all your stormy churnings fulfill his word. Mountains and all hills [praise the Lord], fruit trees and all cedars! Beasts and all livestock, creeping things and flying birds! (verses 9–10) Put together, verses 3–10 encompass the entire cosmic and terrestrial ecosystem: the heavenly lights — sun, moon, and stars; weather elements — storm clouds, lightning, snow, fog, and powerful winds; land and sea features — oceanic canyons under the waterline and the soaring Alps above the waterline; all plant life — fruit trees and tall cedars; the animal and insect kingdoms — from sea creatures to wild animals to domesticated animals, including every crawling creature (like beetles) and every flying bird in the sky. All of it is God’s handiwork. All of it is designed by God! Chorus from Humanity Intentionally, the psalm ends with us, with people at the bottom of the praise sandwich. First it’s all peoples — of all tribes and peoples! Kings of the earth and all peoples [impressive people and unimpressive people], princes and all rulers of the earth! Young men and maidens together [both sexes], old men and children [whole age range]! Let them praise the name of the Lord [Why? Here’s the ground of human praise], for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. (verses 11–13) Godward praise from every human on earth is fitting because God’s majesty is beyond Mars.3 This creation, in all its luster here, is a mere echo of God’s essential majesty. The majesty of this creation points to a supreme majesty beyond the stars — a majesty that warrants praise from every human. Everyone! All peoples of all ranks, classes, and ages, both sexes, and all the peoples of all the nations of the world — the rich, the famous, the elderly, the ignored nobodies — everyone praise this God! You, human, were made for this very purpose! Then the psalm ends with a specific call to God’s people to praise. He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his saints, for the people of Israel who are near to him. Praise the Lord! (verse 14) Only those close to God praise God. You can be religious and distant from God, but true worshipers are affectionate. They are those who draw near to God.4 So, the God whose majesty extends beyond Mars draws me close to himself. Do you have that category in your theology? Or do those poles rip your theology in half? Your joy demands that you learn to hold that together: “I draw near to the God who exceeds all of creation.” Five Pleas for Every Person Based on this psalm, I want to close with five pleas to my fellow humans. 1. Human, behold the God who made every atom in the universe to worship God. Look around you! Every atomic particle in creation exists because God decreed that it exist — and he willed it into existence for his own glory. He made all things for himself. As Paul says, “By him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:16). From the giant blazing heart of our galaxy down to dancing electrons, all things exist for him. This is why John Calvin makes the bold assertion that “the whole order of nature is subverted and overthrown, if the same God who is the beginning of all things, is not also the end of all things.”5 The entire structure and coherence of the natural world breaks apart into nihilistic chaos if the Creator is not also the goal. So, if God’s creation fails to point to God’s glory as its final goal, all of creation collapses into total absurdity. There is zero rationale for creation to exist other than to say that God made it for himself. God is the point of creation. And if that’s true, then we ask, “Okay, so how is God the end of creation?” It’s not automatic. Psalm 148 is teaching us how. 2. Human, listen to the sermon of the silent majesty of creation. The heavens are preaching a sermon to us! Listen to Psalm 19 (which is weird). First, it says, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge” (verses 1–2). And then it says, “There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world” (verses 3–4). So odd. Creation preaches a sermon, with words — kind of. But if you can’t hear it, there are no words. But if you can hear it, there are words. “When you praise God, you awaken the muted glory of creation and put that praise into words.” Psalm 148 says the whole creation of God preaches to us; its creatures declare to us his majesty, his wisdom and power and mercy. Birds soaring, oceans roaring, the Alps stretching up into the clouds — if we simply pay attention, “they all declare to us that we ought to worship, to fear, to love and obey, the God that made all these things.”6 But here’s the problem behind it all. “All the Creatures that are visible, are mute, besides man.”7 In the words of one Puritan, “The other creatures cannot praise their Maker, but by dumb signs and hints to man.”8 Dumb signs and hints. This is like in a movie when someone gets kidnapped. They’re gagged, duct-taped, locked in a room, but eventually they get put on video to show proof of life — and the person kidnapped blinks Morse code, or they keep looking to initials they etched on the wall. That’s creation: duct-taped, but nodding something to us. The sun blazing, the eagle soaring, the thunder echoing — all of it is trying to speak in dumb signs and hints. Here is another metaphor. Creation is “like a beautifully printed book, opened for one to see the beauty of the characters, without understanding the language it speaks.”9 It’s like a toddler picking up a dazzling fifteenth-century manuscript, elegantly illustrated by hand in bright inks — but the meaning of the book is veiled. The child admires the shape of the letters, the illustrations, the colors, the symmetry of the layout, and the richness of the parchment, yet that toddler remains utterly ignorant of the message that it contains. Creation is the immaculately illustrated manuscript that testifies of God’s intelligence, full of words. But unless the Spirit teaches your soul to read the characters, there are no words. Pick your metaphor. It’s a sermon manuscript without a preacher, a passive monument standing in the middle of the desert for some reason but without a legible sign, a kidnapped man giving hints and nods, a beautiful book with mysterious characters, a hymnbook left unread, a man-sized beetle. There’s a frustration within the non-volitional created order because it cannot fulfill its purpose. 3. Human, feel the cosmic nudge to worship God. If God has lifted the veil and you can now read the manuscript, here’s what creation says in all caps: “You, human, who still wants to be happy, leave the idols that you made with your own hands and worship the God who made everything!” That’s the sermon. If you have ears to hear it, that’s what you hear. Creation does not merely exist to display beauty — it exists to call you to worship the God beyond the created beauty. Don’t worship the sun. Hear the sun declare, “Worship my Maker!” Here’s Jonathan Edwards: “If we look to the heavens or the earth; or birds, beasts, or fishes; or plants and trees: if we do but take notice of it, they all declare to us that we ought to worship, to fear, to love and obey, the God that made all these things.”10 Yes, every leaf, every feather, every star is a silent messenger pointing you toward your duty of delight. A universe made by God and for God is not a neutral world; it’s “a theater of God’s magnificence”11 for your senses to delight in the majesty of your God. Do you feel this nudge toward worship? Or are thunderstorms just some indifferent system that mixes temperature, pressure, humidity, and blind physical laws? Or do those storms point you to God’s majesty? We’re moving toward understanding this psalm. So, (1) behold the God who made all things for himself; (2) listen for the silent song; (3) feel creation nudge you to worship. And now . . . 4. Human, give voice to creation’s worship. For centuries, theologians have seen this reality in creation. When you praise God, you do more than simply fulfill your own purpose. When you praise, you awaken the muted glory of creation and put that praise into words. We are the mouth through which the whole created order was meant to speak. This is so insightfully put by Edwards that I went into the Yale archive and pulled the page of this sermon to show you his own handwriting. Edwards declares, God “made man and Placed him here to be the Eye of the Creation to see the Glory that he manifests and the tongue to declare it.”12 We are the eye of creation — to take in nature’s glory. And we are the tongue of creation — to express creation’s praise to the Creator. The stars, the skies, the snow, the ocean, the insects, and the birds of the earth — none of them has a voice to speak their Creator’s praise. But their beauty, their order, their strength are a hymnbook. Samuel Rutherford has his own metaphor. Creation is like a neglected harp in a dusty corner, “which of itself can make no Music. The creatures borrow man’s mouth and tongue to speak what they have been thinking of God and his excellency these five thousand years.” The world is filled with silent instruments! No animal can form thanks. The trees do not declare the kindness of their Maker. The stars cannot praise the One who hung them. But we can — and must — give language to their worship. This is not just poetic possibility; this is a priestly calling! Here again is Jonathan Edwards: “All other creatures bring their tribute of glory to humans, to be offered up through our hands to the Creator.”13 So, what does all this mean? 5. Human, you are the high priest of creation’s worship. God redeemed his people through the blood of our high priest, Jesus Christ, and he redeemed us to function in creation as “high priests,” to offer up the praises of all creation to God.14 As leaders of creation’s worship, we are not simply fulfilling some obligation. No. We have entered into a joy for which we were made — to know, love, and rejoice in the Creator, and to lead all of creation in this sacred praise. Our worship fulfills our own purpose as it completes the silent adoration of all creation. This is why we humans occupy such a central position in the cosmic order, set apart by our ability to know God in ways no other creature can. As “the tongue in the body,” we speak on behalf of creation, articulating its silent praise to the Maker, in effect gathering up a “tribute of praise” from the mountains, oceans, birds, and beasts, to return to God.15 I love ethics. I love talking about smartphones, social media, Hollywood’s spectacle-making machine, Silicon Valley, big tech, AI, and all that. And I’ve given my life to helping you find answers to life’s hardest struggles in the Ask Pastor John podcast. In fact, on my flight here, I was reviewing a long list of new questions for next season. Great questions! (Glad to be on my side of the microphone asking the questions and not his side of the mic having to answer them!) I love applied Christianity in the nitty-gritty of this life. There’s a time to answer pressing questions. And there’s time, like tonight, to step back and answer no pressing question — to simply take in God’s grand design for the universe. Will Psalm 148 fix your marriage, or your kids, or your workplace tensions, or your fear of the future? Maybe. I think it can, but indirectly. My mom sews. For years she’s made cloth dolls. And when you sew them together, basically you’re working on the doll inside out. All the messy seams are showing. The doll is misshapen as its face looks entirely inside of itself. And then, when it’s time to stuff the doll, you turn it right side out, and all the seams go inside. Psalm 148 is like that. It takes self-focused, miserable, depressed sinners, focused on themselves, and turns them right side out, to see themselves in God’s plan for the universe. Psalm 148 has a simple and profound point. When the psalmist calls for non-volitional creatures to praise God, “all this is but to quicken up his own heart to that duty which was his, rather than theirs,” because in this way are we told that “all God’s works are said to praise him, as they become to man both the motives and subjects of [our] praise.”16 Do you see that? When we behold God’s “invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature,” which we behold “in the things that have been made” (Romans 1:20) — when we see God’s majesty beyond creation glimmering in creation, at that moment his creation is praising him through us.17 Psalm 148 isn’t about training dolphins to sing Getty songs. It was written because every single command to worship for the stars and whales and storm clouds and lightning and snow and fog and gusty storm winds and canyons under the waterline and mountains and hills above the waterline and trees and birds and insects — every command for creation to worship is a new command for us to joyfully worship the Creator. You still want to be happy. You do! I know you do, because God sparked that undying desire inside each of us. You can’t extinguish it. And your desire to be happy is why God made himself the end of creation. He’s the point of creation. In his design, his glory and our happiness are wedded together in one as we worship him, taking in creation’s majesty with our eyes, to sing that praise back to the Creator with our mouths. We are the happy choir of creation. Creation is drawing us together, even tonight, into a choir assembled at the very center of God’s purpose for everything else that he has made.

During the attack by the Huaorani, at least one of them shot his gun in the air. But none of them shot at the natives in self-defense. Why not? (They had agreed on this ahead of time; it was a principle, not a mere impulse.) First, it was because Christ conquered by suffering and death, not self-defense, and called us to deny ourselves and shoulder our cross, not shoot our gun. Second, they said, “The natives are not ready for heaven, and we are” (see End of the Spear, 35). Had they saved their lives by killing their attackers, would those five valiant, Christ-exalting servants of Christ have spent their next fifty years of missionary service any more fruitfully for God’s saving purposes than what God wrought through their deaths? Surely none of us would dare to say such a thing. I’m going to try to show you from Luke 22:35–53 that the mission of the church — to call people from all the ethnic groups in the world to repentance and faith in Jesus — triumphs through prayerful suffering, not self-defense. This is not a message about the biblical legitimacy of a police force and a military, both of which God has invested with the sword, according to Romans 13:4. It’s about the mindset of countercultural Christians, who are sojourners and exiles in this world (1 Peter 2:11), who represent a kingdom that is not of this world (John 18:36), who say with the apostle Paul, “When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we entreat” (1 Corinthians 4:12–13). It’s about a mindset that does not say, while preaching the sacrifice of Christ, “Don’t mess with me; I’ve got a gun.” Instead, it says (in the words of Revelation 12:11), “They have conquered [the evil one] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.” Scenes of Sovereign Care This drama unfolds in Luke 22:35–53 through four scenes. I’ll give you names for each and then we will walk through them. Scene 1 (Luke 22:35–38): God’s sovereign care through suffering, not sword Scene 2 (Luke 22:39–46): God’s sovereign care through prayer, not sleep Scene 3 (Luke 22:47–51): God’s sovereign care rejected Scene 4 (Luke 22:52–53): God’s sovereign care through temporary demonic triumph I’m using the word sovereign because God is manifestly in absolute control throughout these scenes. We see it at the beginning, in Luke 22:37: “This Scripture must be fulfilled.” We see it at the end (Luke 22:53), where Jesus says to the evil forces, “You get one hour.” We see it in the middle (Luke 22:42), where he says, “Your will be done, not mine.” And I’m using the word care because, from beginning to end, Luke is telling this story to strengthen his disciples for the mission, which will involve suffering but will have God’s care through it all. We will see this as we go. Scene 1: Sovereign Care Through Suffering And he said to them, “When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.” He said to them, “But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about me has its fulfillment.” And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” And he said to them, “It is enough.” (Luke 22:35–38) What’s going on here is that Jesus is preparing his disciples — indeed, his church — for a radical shift from a local, Palestine-oriented, village-to-village, three-year ministry where they could depend on hospitality and didn’t need a moneybag or a knapsack or extra sandals, to a global mission extending for thousands of miles in totally unknown territories, climates, languages, and dangers. He will announce this mission to them explicitly in Luke 24:46–47: Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. So, there will be a radical alteration in mission from local, familiar Jewish ministry to global world evangelization among all the peoples of the world. And he captures the newness of this mission with his instructions: “Now go get a moneybag and a knapsack and a sword.” But the question Jesus asks in verse 35 is, “Did you lack anything [in my service]?” The answer was no. Did Jesus mean, then, in verse 36, “I took care of you when you had no moneybag or knapsack, but now you have to take care of yourselves, hence the money and the sword”? “The mission of the church triumphs through prayerful suffering, not self-defense.” Surely not. He didn’t call attention to the Father’s sovereign care for the last three years just to pull the rug out from under them as he sends them into the world. It’s just the opposite. “As you were cared for then, so you’ll be cared for now — only, it’s a radically new situation globally.” And this is the main reason it’s new, in verse 37 (quoting Isaiah 53:12): “He was numbered with the transgressors.” New Intercession, New Mission Here’s the verse in Isaiah: He poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors. As Jesus quotes from this verse, notice the “must” at the beginning of Luke 22:37: “This Scripture must be fulfilled in me.” And there is certainty at the end of the verse: “What is written about me has its fulfillment.” In other words, “My time to die has come. And it is absolutely certain that it will happen, for God has spoken.” We need to feel the tension of this moment. Judas has made a pact with the chief priests (verse 5). Jesus has said at the Last Supper, “I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes” (verse 18). And he has said to Peter, “The rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me” (verse 34). In other words, “Brothers, this is it. Tonight, it all comes to a head. Your global mission will be established today, in the next 24 hours. And here’s how it’s going to happen: I will be numbered with the transgressors — any minute. I will be counted as a criminal. And when they kill me, I will bear the sin of many, and I will intercede for transgressors rather than defending myself from them.” He’s saying, “This is why I’m alerting you to the new situation. God will care for you, just like he is going to care for me in these next hours. I will accomplish more for your eternal care in these next hours than you could ever imagine. But we are not on a crusade to conquer with the sword. We will conquer through suffering.” Swords for the Mission? Here’s a key question: Why did Luke include verse 38? “And they said, ‘Look, Lord, here are two swords.’ And he said to them, ‘It is enough.’” Luke could have gone straight from verse 37 (“I’m going to be counted with transgressors”) to verse 39 (“He went with them to the Mount of Olives and prayed”). Why circle back to the sword? It’s to show how badly they misunderstand him. They can feel what’s about to happen: “He just told us to get swords, and he just said that he’s about to be counted as a criminal. So, who has a sword? Okay, good! We have two. Jesus, we don’t have as many as you said, but we have two, so we’ll do the best we can to protect you.” What does Jesus mean when he responds, “It is enough” (verse 38)? It’s singular, not plural. He doesn’t say, “Two is enough. Don’t forget, I’m God. We’ll manage fine with two swords.” He says, “It’s enough. That’s enough” — in view of what’s about to happen in verse 50, when Peter takes one of those swords and chops off the servant’s ear, to which Jesus says, “Time out,” and puts the ear back on (interceding for the transgressor!). I think what he means here in verse 38 is this: “You have missed my meaning so badly that we’re not going to talk about this anymore tonight. We’re done. There is no time. I’ve got business to do in prayer with my Father, and you are going to have to learn the hard way.” Whatever those swords were for (or the missionaries’ guns), they were not for defending Jesus. And by implication, they’re not for defending the representatives of Jesus in their Christlike ministry. This is why, in the book of Acts (which Luke himself wrote), not once do you find a Christian using the sword to defend himself from stoning, or lashing, or mob violence, or imprisonment. The message of scene 1 is this: “Whether you live or whether you die, trust me and you will have God’s sovereign care through suffering, not sword.” Scene 2: Sovereign Care Through Prayer They leave the upper room and go to the Mount of Olives. At the beginning of the scene, in verse 40, Jesus says to the disciples, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.” And at the end of the scene, in verse 46, he says, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.” I take that to mean: “Listen, my dear, dear disciples: The mission that I am sending you on (even tonight) is going to test you and tempt you to the limit of your abilities. The only way you will be able to carry it out is with the sovereign strengthening of God, sought and found through prayer, not sleeping. Just like you need to follow me on the Calvary road of suffering [scene 1], so you need to follow me on the Gethsemane road of prayer [scene 2]. I’m going to get strength for the next hours of temptation through prayer. You must do the same, or you will fail.” So, here’s what Luke tells us about Jesus’s praying: [He prayed,] saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. (Luke 22:42–44) There is some evidence that verses 43–44 are not in all the oldest manuscripts. In other words, it may be that Luke didn’t write them. But I’m treating them as authentic, first, because they are the sort of thing a scribe would be tempted to take out rather than put in, since they focus so much on Jesus’s weakness; and second, because they fit the flow of Luke’s thought so well. Jesus’s human nature recoils from the prospect of nails going through his hands, thorns piercing his skull, a whip lashing his back, and all the horror of bearing the sins of man and the wrath of God. It is incomprehensible to us the degree to which Jesus will suffer in those next hours. There is nothing sinful in expressing his horror at this prospect to his Father and then submitting utterly to the Father’s sovereign, all-wise, gracious will. After he submits to God in verse 42, verse 43 says an angel from heaven appears to him and strengthens him. Remember, he has a human nature as well as a divine nature. In his human nature, he models for us how to live as humans. We need God’s strengthening to avoid being defeated by temptation and trials. So did Jesus. “We are not on a crusade to conquer with the sword. We will conquer through suffering.” So, when the angel strengthens him, what happens in verse 44? “Being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” The strengthening from God does not replace his prayer; it empowers his prayer to endure with bloody earnestness. What does he pray with such earnestness? Here’s what Hebrews 5:7 says: In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. If we take Gethsemane as a chief instance where this kind of crying with tears happens, what he is praying for is this: “O God, please don’t let my human nature give way under the awful pressure of this suffering. Don’t let death conquer me rather than me conquering death. Don’t let the horrors of death tomorrow destroy my faith or my obedience, but save me from such an obedience-destroying death. Give me victory over the deadly temptations of death.” Hebrews 5:7 says that God answered that prayer. So, Jesus stands up. And he is ready. The battle has been won; it has been won through prayer. He goes and finds the disciples sleeping. They have not won their battle, and their defeat will show immediately. So, the point of scene 2 is to show God’s sovereign care through prayer, not sleep. Scene 3: Sovereign Care Rejected First, Judas rejects God’s sovereign care; then the disciples do. Judas rejects it by misusing a kiss. The disciples reject it by misusing a sword. While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” (Luke 22:47–48) In other words: “A kiss! My dear friend, it’s one thing to betray me. But to do it with a kiss? This is a dagger before the nails. This is what happens, Judas, when you cease to rest in God’s sovereign care and give way to the love of money, my dear keeper of the moneybag — thirty pieces of silver and a kiss. You won’t be able to live with this.” And then the disciples fail. Verses 49–51 say, And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, “No more of this!” And he touched his ear and healed him. They don’t wait for an answer to the question, “Shall we strike?” They just do it. They think they have his permission — his command, even! He has said, “Sell your cloak and buy a sword” (see verse 36). So, just like in verse 38, Jesus says, “Stop. Time out. Let me show you what I think of your use of the sword to defend me from the transgressors.” And he heals the high priest’s servant. He undoes the self-defending sword — the mission-advancing sword. Judas rejects God’s sovereign care. The disciples reject God’s sovereign care. They think they will provide their own. Scene 3 shows that rejection. Scene 4: Sovereign Care Through Temporary Demonic Triumph Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” (Luke 22:52–53) They had every chance to arrest him in the daylight, but they do it in the dark. Of course they do it in the dark! This moment is the crescendo, the embodiment of the power of darkness, Satan himself. He cannot do anything darker or more wicked than to treat the Son of God as a criminal — to number him among the transgressors — and to lead him to the slaughter. In the annals of hell, this is Satan’s finest hour. And when Jesus says, at the end of verse 53, “This is your hour, and the power of darkness,” he is expressing again the absolute sovereignty of God over this entire affair. “You, Satan, get one hour to do this dark, dirty work. And you get it because, even though you think that darkness has triumphed, you are committing suicide.” As Paul says in Colossians 2:15, “[God] disarmed the rulers and authorities . . . by triumphing over them in [the cross].” In summary: Scene 1 (Luke 22:35–38): God’s sovereign care through suffering, not sword Scene 2 (Luke 22:39–46): God’s sovereign care through prayer, not sleep Scene 3 (Luke 22:47–51): God’s sovereign care rejected Scene 4 (Luke 22:52–53): God’s sovereign care through temporary demonic triumph This is our calling as Christians: to rest gladly in the sovereign care of God through suffering, not sword; through prayer, not sleep; never taking matters into our own hands; and confident in the face of every temporary demonic triumph that God is going to turn it for our good. That’s why he “was numbered with the transgressors” (Luke 22:37). That’s why he died for us and did not defend himself.

[Because] whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it. [Because] what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? [Because] what can a man give in return for his soul? [Because] whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” (Mark 8:34–38) “If you would come after me, deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow me because . . . because . . . because . . . because.” I will only linger here at the surface level of grammar for a moment, just long enough to make two points. First, if any of these graduates (college or seminary) can read that paragraph without seeing those four layers of argumentation (“because . . . because . . . because . . . because”), in their case we have failed. Because that’s what we do here at Bethlehem College and Seminary: We learn together how to see — how to see what is really there in the word and in the world. The second point, while I’m lingering at the level of grammar, is this: We don’t just learn together how to see, but we also learn how to see through. Words exist (and grammar exists) to communicate reality. Who cares about words? Well, God cares about words, because that’s what he gave us. But ultimately, they are his appointed means through which we see reality — ultimately, the reality of the glory of God in the face of Christ. “Preferring comfort over cross-bearing will destroy you, and preferring Christ over life will save you.” Almost all of my earthly life is behind me. What’s left, I hope to live with all my might while I live. And when I look back, it is increasingly clear to me that, for over fifty years, most of my time has been devoted to seeing and seeing through to reality: understanding it, valuing it, feeling it, applying it, saying it. These are the habits of mind and heart I long for our students to gain. We are learning together how to see and how to see through. Through Words to Reality Let’s move through the grammar of Jesus’s words — through the argument — and focus on the reality behind the fourth and final reason Jesus gives for taking up our cross and following him. Deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow him, first, because preferring comfort over cross-bearing will destroy you, and preferring Christ over life will save you. Why is that? Because if you devote your life to the pursuit of security and comfort and ease, and you succeed and gain the whole world, it will be of zero benefit, because you will lose your soul forever. Why is that? Because no matter how much you gain in this world, the soul is not for sale. There will be no dealing, no negotiating on the last day. If you lose it, it’s over — forever. Why is that? Why is it too late? Why no dealing or negotiating? Because “whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels” (Mark 8:38). So, let’s try to see through that last argument. What does it mean that Jesus will be ashamed of those who were ashamed of him? Humiliation on the Last Day Shame is a painful thing. Another word for it would be humiliation. Will Jesus be humiliated at the last judgment? When Jesus says the Son of Man will be ashamed of those who were ashamed of him, does he mean, “The Son of Man will be humiliated on the day of judgment”? No. Jesus will never feel the pain of shame at being scorned for acting foolishly, because he never has acted foolishly and never will, and because he is not controlled by what others think of him. He won’t be humiliated. “[He] endured the cross, despising the shame” (Hebrews 12:2). What then does it mean that the Son of Man will be ashamed of those who were ashamed of him? It means the same thing as people being ashamed of him here in Mark 8:34–37. The way they were ashamed of him, he will be ashamed of them. How did that play out — that people were ashamed of him? What did it mean for them to be ashamed of Jesus and his words? The people Jesus will be ashamed of in this text are not people who were shamed and humiliated because they stood up for Jesus. No. The people he will be ashamed of are those who sought to save their earthly lives and get rich by avoiding the negative effects of standing up for Jesus and his words — by avoiding the pain of being shamed. In other words, in this text, to be ashamed of Jesus means to be so fearful of being shamed for Jesus that you don’t stand up for Jesus. You don’t get humiliated. You love your reputation, your comfort, your money, your life. So, to save your life — your ego — you keep your mouth shut. But the apostles were shamed for the name of Jesus in Acts 5:41, and they embraced it. They went out “rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer [shame] for the name.” They were shamed, but they were not ashamed. The people in Mark 8:34–38 who are ashamed of Jesus did not embrace the shame or rejoice over it. They avoided it. They did not stand up for Jesus. They saved their lives and padded them with wealth and comfort and the approval of an adulterous and sinful generation. Now we can see what it will mean for Jesus to be ashamed of those who were ashamed of him. Just as these faithless ones would have been humiliated if they had stood up for Jesus in an adulterous and sinful generation (and so, they chose not to), so Jesus would be humiliated if he were to stand up for them in the presence of his Father and the holy angels (and so, he chooses not to). They avoid humiliation by not acknowledging Jesus; he avoids humiliation by not acknowledging them (Matthew 10:32–33). They refused to advocate for Jesus to avoid shame; Jesus will refuse to advocate for them to avoid shame. They saved face with fools by distancing themselves from the wise; Jesus will save face with the wise by distancing himself from fools. Or, to simply use the words of Mark 8:38, “Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” See and See Through To bring this now to a particular application and exhortation for the graduates, I ask this question: Is what we have seen in Mark 8:38 salvation by grace through faith? Or is it an earned salvation through works? To answer that question, ask another one: Do you earn the love Christ has for you by treasuring the love of Christ? You don’t. Ephesians 2:4–5 says that you weren’t even alive when God loved you with a great love that made you alive. This is not your own doing. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast (Ephesians 2:8–9). If you are ashamed of Christ and his words — if you value the approval of an adulterous generation more than you value Christ — you are not failing to earn the love of Christ. You are failing to see it for what it is. “To be ashamed of Jesus means to be so fearful of being shamed for Jesus that you don’t stand up for Jesus.” We have spent four years laboring with you to learn how to see and to see through — to value and embrace and treasure the infinite worth and beauty and greatness of the love of God in Christ. This is what you will do for the rest of your life. You will labor to see and to see through to the infinite value of Christ. If you turn away from the treasure of Christ and value the approval of an adulterous generation more than you value him and his approval — if you are ashamed of him — this will not be a failure to earn the love of Christ; it will be a failure to see. These four years have been a beginning, a launch into lifelong learning to see and to see through — to see that Jesus is wiser, stronger, more precious, more valuable, more desirable, more satisfying than the approval of all the world. Keep on seeing the word and seeing through to reality, and you will never be ashamed. John Piper (@JohnPiper) is founder and teacher of Desiring God and chancellor of Bethlehem College and Seminary.

In 2025, many of our biggest issues have to do with our humanity and, in particular, our human bodies: Sexuality and “gender” Bodily presence vs. remoteness Emotional presence vs. distraction Human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence The sedentariness of life and work vs. the need for exercise Technology as extensions of our bodies, helping us do things vs. simply doing things for us Our explosion of technological innovations in the modern world has not caught God off guard. He made the world, and us, for this. He put the raw materials for technology into the same rich dust from which he formed Adam. Technology is a God-ordained, God-approved aspect of the creation mandate (to be fruitful and multiply and have dominion; Genesis 1:28), as well as the Great Commission (to make disciples of Jesus; Matthew 28:19). Our various tools and devices can be used wisely and for good, or sinfully and for destruction. Living as Fully Human One of the biggest challenges of our lifetimes will be living fully human lives in a dehumanizing age. Would it be true that today the average person feels less and less human? Our pace of life How little we sleep What we eat and drink The increasing remoteness and thinness of our relationships The power of our tools and technologies that subtly condition us to do, and even to attempt, less and less In such times, the Christian faith grounds us in our creatureliness and calls us back to a life that is more fully human, living as the humble creatures God made. (Human and humble are from the same ancient root, meaning “earth.”) The many and wonderful technologies we’re making from the ground can lead us to forget our creatureliness, that we too are from the ground, and to the ground we will soon return. In case you’ve been conditioned to overlook the inimitable design, abilities, and beauty of the human body, and instead to gawk at machines (most recently, AI), Tony Reinke pays stunning tribute to our Creator’s genius in his book, quoting and commenting on a video by Kevin Kelly called “The Future of Robots” (page 251 in God, Technology, and the Christian Life). How prone are we to marvel at what the smartphone can do and overlook the stunning abilities of the hand that holds and taps and scrolls this phone, and is far more impressive and valuable than the device! Value the Body One of the key points of overlap between Tony and me in our respective theologies of technology and exercise is the human body. In Tony’s last chapter, he says, “Technologies that devalue the human body will never honor the Creator” (253). So, a key question for new technologies will be, Do they honor the human body or not? That may be the unifying focus of our projects: the Christian valuing of the human body that honors our Creator, which is no small thing. That’s why God made the world, and why he made us — for his glory (1 Corinthians 6:20; 10:31). At Desiring God, we believe that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him — so a Christian vision for technology, and a Christian vision for exercise, has at its heart our seeing, enjoying, and representing our God by the ways we steward the most amazing created reality in all the world: ourselves. The banner we put on this gathering today is “Unusually Human.” We believe that at least one aspect of our call as Christians in such times is to be unusually human. That is, fully human — which, sadly, may seem to be less and less usual even among professing Christians, with screens, with AI, with all manner of augmentation to our bodies, and with the effect our technological habits have on our bodies and souls over time. I really struggled with what to do in these first few minutes before throwing the door open for Q&A. First, I planned to focus on the human body, since the body is a main point of intersection between our two projects. But then I realized, I would hardly be saying anything about exercise. So, first I planned to flesh out this outline, but now I’ll just give it to you. This is the story of the human body in six layers: God made our bodies. Sin has seized our bodies. God himself took a human body (and accomplished our redemption in a human body). God himself dwells in our bodies (the Holy Spirit). We glorify God now in our bodies. We await a spectacular bodily upgrade. I realize that, of those six, the one that’s the most live (and perhaps feels the most immediately relevant) is the one with the now: We glorify God now in our bodies. So, let me say a little bit more about that, and then I’d like to finish with ten brief maxims on the Christian and physical exercise. Then we’ll bring up Tony and answer questions together about both tech and exercise. So, first, here are three truths to clarify bodily existence for the Christian. (All three are relevant to both tech and exercise.) 1. God is for the body. God is not opposed to or uninterested in our bodily existence. He is for the body. “The body is . . . meant . . . for the Lord, and the Lord for the body” (1 Corinthians 6:13). In the new heavens and new earth, we will have resurrection bodies. Bodies aren’t going away. He’s for stewarding your body — not neglecting it and not worshiping it. 2. God commends bodily exertion. God plainly commends the use of our bodies through the effort of work (Ephesians 4:28; 2 Thessalonians 3:10), even hard work (2 Timothy 2:6). We are not to be idle but “busy at work” (2 Thessalonians 3:11). Laziness is sin and both a physical and spiritual danger (Proverbs 21:25). And God designed our bodies to reward work and physical exertion. What’s more, 1 Timothy 4:8 affirms the value of bodily training. That affirmation comes on top of the assumption in ancient times of a far greater degree of physical activity in the course of normal life and work, not to mention travel, than we assume now. Even in that far more active context in the ancient world, the apostle commends physical training. 3. Spiritual health is ultimate; physical health is not. Tony and I both emphasize this in our projects. To say it another way, related to exercise, an asymmetrical relationship exists between our eternal souls and current bodies. This is an important clarification, often overlooked in efforts to rescue the physical life from neglect and spiritualism. For the Christian, the charge to bodily training and physical exertion is qualified. Observe the balancing word of 1 Timothy 4:8: “While bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.” The recognition that “bodily training is of some value” cuts both ways: Those today who are sedentary by choice may need to own that God does indeed value the use and exertion of our bodies (and he designed them to work best and happiest when moving). And those who are prone to make exercise a new idol may need to own that it is only of some value, relativized by the pursuit of holistic godliness, which “is of value in every way.” The ultimacy of spiritual health doesn’t mean that the health of the body is insignificant or marginal. (This is where some Christians have gone wrong.) Rather, bodily movement and exertion are important, and as Christians we put the body to work in service of our souls and the souls of others. Here’s how Tony says it, related to technology: Colonizing Mars is not man’s greatest challenge. In a techno-materialistic world, new innovations are inevitable. The real challenge is in seeking spiritual flourishing. (283) That’s what we’re after: seeking spiritual flourishing, with our tech and with our exercise. Exercise for Spiritual Flourishing So, then, how might we approach exercise, at least, in ways that seek spiritual flourishing? “Christian fitness orients not to looking good but to doing good.” As a pastor, this is my interest in exercise: how it serves not only natural joy but spiritual joy, and so glorifies God through doing good for others. How might exercising my body serve my soul — my spiritual flourishing — and so make me more ready to do good and love others and honor God? I finish with ten brief maxims on a Christian vision for exercise. 1. God made us to move and to meditate. Earlier, we talked about the remarkable flexibility we have as humans. God made us the kind of creatures who think and feel, and also move and act. He made us for contemplation and for exertion, for pondering and for doing. He designed you for rhythms of life: not always being on the go, not always being on the stay. We glorify him by reflecting on him, and rejoicing in him, and representing him in the world. We meditate and move. Typical human life includes both. 2. No body is perfect. I mean that in two ways. All of us are sinners. Sin dwells in us and affects us, soul and body, in all our faculties. So, nobody is perfect. And no body is perfect. No one has a perfect body. Because of human sin, we live in a cursed world, and in this cursed world, none of us is without ailments. Most of us know, all too well and all too painfully, how far from perfect our bodies are. All the more with our fickle, invisible hearts. We all have weaknesses and various disabilities, some major, many very minor. In this fallen world, oh, how we should regularly thank God for what bodily abilities we do have. 3. Our modern lives are far more sedentary than our ancestors’. Read the old books and see how timeless the motions of the human heart and soul are. Our inner lives resonate deeply with the Psalms. But my, how different our outer lives can seem, and that largely because of technology. A major aspect of that is how sedentary life is today vs. biblical times, when they walked everywhere they went and had no screens. This is a good place to give a definition of exercise, which is a pretty modern phenomenon (especially in the last 150 years). I’m gleaning this from Daniel Lieberman’s book Exercised. Exercise is “voluntary physical activity undertaken for the sake of health and fitness” (xii). I’m a pastor and editor. My work life is very sedentary. Other than public speaking, I’m usually sitting at a computer or sitting in a meeting. If I don’t undertake “voluntary physical activity,” I’ll hardly do anything physical, and will soon be out of shape for the few important physical activities I do need to undertake. 4. Fitness is a term Christians can appreciate. The question is, “Fit for what?” Twice Paul uses a phrase that would be a great banner to fly over Christian fitness: “ready for every good work” (2 Timothy 2:21; Titus 3:1). Are you ready to do good? Are you fit for good works? The healthy Christian life is no passive existence, which we should keep in mind in an age that subtly conditions us into greater and greater comfort and passivity. As Christians, we find the words of Jesus and his apostles calling us to action again and again. J.C. Ryle observes, It would not be difficult to point out at least twenty-five or thirty distinct passages in the Epistles where believers are plainly taught to use active personal exertion, and are addressed as responsible for doing energetically what Christ would have them do, and are not told to “yield themselves” up as passive agents and sit still, but to arise and work. A holy violence, a conflict, a warfare, a fight, a soldier’s life, a wrestling, are spoken of as characteristic of the true Christian. (Holiness, xxiii–xxiv) This leads to the fifth point. 5. Christian fitness orients not to looking good but to doing good. Matthew 5:16 says, “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see” — what? Your washboard abs? Your beach body or beach muscles? No — “your good works [probably fully clothed as you do them] and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” You do them with such effectiveness and humility that others see you but give glory to your Father in heaven. Our charge is to make physical exertion a means, among others, to spiritual health and joy. Regular bodily movement and exertion put me in a better position to clearly see and deeply savor God in Christ, and then do others good to show them him as well. 6. Exercise is an acquired taste. This is from personal experience, reading it in others, and common sense. The joy of movement grows over time. As your legs and lungs are conditioned, it’s less uncomfortable and more enjoyable to put them to work. Let this be an encouragement if you’ve tried exercise and it felt terrible. Energy grows by expending energy; you increase your capacity by expending what you have. Week one is the worst week. It often gets better from there if you stick with it. 7. Exercise serves brain function. This has been my biggest discovery as I’ve aged, not just in experience but in the literature. As Harvard psychiatrist John Ratey writes, We all know that exercise makes us feel better, but most of us have no idea why. We assume it’s because we’re burning off stress or reducing muscle tension or boosting endorphins, and we leave it at that. But the real reason we feel so good when we get our blood pumping is that it makes the brain function at its best, and in my view, this benefit of physical activity is far more important — and fascinating — than what it does for the body. Building muscles and conditioning the heart and lungs are essentially side effects. I often tell my patients that the point of exercise is to build and condition the brain. (Spark, 3, emphasis added) Exercise relates to alertness and clarity of thought, and richness and depth of feeling. None of these produces spiritual joy, but it sure helps in the pursuit of spiritual joy when you’re not beginning with a natural joy deficit. 8. Learning to push the body translates into instincts of a healthy soul. Pushing yourself into the discomfort of exercise trains your will not to give in so quickly when you experience resistance. The hills that matter most in life are typically the hardest ones to climb, and pushing your body to climb or run hills conditions your will to engage and endure the relational and emotional hills we encounter in life and work and Christian mission. 9. We tend to overestimate what can be done in the short run and underestimate what can be done in the long run. This is especially true with the body (and perhaps all the more with the inner person). The body is very conditionable — you just can’t do it all at once. If you’re out of shape, you can’t get yourself ready for a marathon by next week. But it’s amazing how you can shape and condition and change your body over six months, and six years. The power of habit is unleashed by small, very doable actions and modest upkeep over time, not by crash diets and unsustainable resolutions. 10. God means for us to pray to him about and for our exercise. That is, we are to “make holy” our bodily life through hearing what he says in his word and responding to him in prayer. First Timothy 4:3 sets the scene of God’s good gifts of bodily life. In this verse, it’s food and the marriage bed, which is why I think the next two verses apply to other aspects of bodily life as well, like sleep and exercise. This is 1 Timothy 4:4–5: Everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. We make bodily life holy, and exercise in particular, by hearing what God has to say in his word about our bodies and their movement and then responding back to him in prayer. Two kinds of prayer are mentioned here. One is receiving his gift of bodily life and movement with thanksgiving. And the second is asking him in prayer, in response to his word, to make our bodily activities holy, to consecrate them to his use and honor in our lives.

Minneapolis and St. Paul need it from me and my family and my church. Wherever Christians have been for two millennia, our neighbors, our coworkers, and our cities have needed these things from us: our witness, our generosity, and our service. The most important of the three is our witness. Witness requires words. Words should provide clarity and specificity. A witness has seen and heard and experienced something important — and so he speaks, with as much clarity and specificity as he can, to testify to others, to tell them about what he has seen and heard and experienced. Witness is most important, because the words of witness give meaning to the acts of generosity and service. But generosity in Jesus’s name, and service in Jesus’s name, play their own essential part in confirming the witness, and adorning our words, and demonstrating the heart of love that goes with the witness and that has been changed by what we’ve witnessed. We witness as those whose lives have been transformed by what and whom we’ve witnessed; we do not witness as mere bystanders. Habits of Love In this session, our focus is on the habits of life that we hope God’s means of grace, and our habits of grace, will produce in us. We could call these “habits of love” — that is, the kind of rhythms and patterns of life we cultivate in Christian love for others, flowing from a heart that is being regularly fed and filled by God’s means of grace in his word, prayer, and fellowship. What we’re doing here is focusing on the last twenty pages of the Habits of Grace book. In the first session tonight, Marshall essentially summarized the book’s first two hundred pages. Now my modest assignment is to capture just the last twenty. My hope in these few minutes is that you would get some clarity about where we want this life, lived in our various “habits of grace,” to lead. Habits of grace, rightly engaged and enjoyed, will lead to habits of love that serve others in the name of Jesus. This is part 4 of the book, which is distinct from the first three parts. Parts 1–3 are about God’s ongoing grace flowing to me, and then, with fellowship, a transition begins to happen as God’s grace also streams through me and my words in the mutual upbuilding of church life. Perhaps my favorite quote (outside the Bible) on the means of grace is from J.C. Ryle (1816–1900): The “means of grace” are such as Bible reading, private prayer, and regularly worshiping God in Church, wherein one hears the Word taught and participates in the Lord’s Supper. I lay it down as a simple matter of fact that no one who is careless about such things must ever expect to make much progress in sanctification. I can find no record of any eminent saint who ever neglected them. They are appointed channels through which the Holy Spirit conveys fresh supplies of grace to the soul and strengthens the work which He has begun in the inward man. . . . Our God is a God who works by means, and He will never bless the soul of that man who pretends to be so high and spiritual that he can get on without them. (Holiness, 26) Now, in this session, our question is this: What do we do with these “fresh supplies of grace [conveyed] to the soul”? What are the means of grace for? Well, for one thing, they deepen and enrich our enjoyment of God in Christ. The fresh supplies of grace cause our souls to survive and to thrive in Jesus. But then what? What about our friends and family and neighbors and city? What about the second-greatest commandment, to love others as we love ourselves (Matthew 22:39)? Nine Companions Recently, I came across a new book that commends nine practices of Jesus as spiritual disciplines for Christians today. Here are the nine: Sabbath Solitude Prayer Fasting Scripture Community Generosity Service Witness Those are nine great practices. But they’re not all alike. This is like a fruit basket; you have some apples and oranges and bananas and a peach. For instance, alongside practices like Sabbath and solitude, couldn’t we add some others? What about sleep, exercise, nature, and music? And what about biblically commanded means not in the list, like baptism and the Lord’s Supper and corporate worship? So, we have work to do here, some triaging and some ordering. How do these good practices relate to each other? Of the nine, two are clearly God-appointed means of grace: Scripture and prayer. One is almost a means of grace, or close to that, or maybe that, depending on how you define it: community. If “community” means casual Christian friends, then it genuinely can assist in our accessing God’s means; but covenant membership in the local church would be the means of grace proper. Then there’s fasting, which I’d call an “appointed assistant.” Fasting, on its own, is not a means of grace, but it accompanies or assists prayer. Fasting is a way of intensifying our prayers. It’s like a megaphone for especially needy prayers. Sabbath and solitude, then, we might call “assistants.” Resting from our vocational labors can assist us in gathering with the church and engaging in communion with God through his word and prayer. Solitude also can assist, if used for engaging with Scripture and for prayer. But as therapeutic and spiritual as they may feel, resting and getting alone on their own are not God’s appointed means of grace, apart from being contexts in which we access his word, prayer, and covenant fellowship. (This is where we could put sleep, exercise, music, and nature; on their own, they are not means of grace. They are normal human activities, which humans everywhere benefit from whether they have faith in Jesus or not. These are good aspects of human life in the world God made that can be good assistants in pursuing God’s grace through his word, prayer, and fellowship. But to convey fresh supplies of grace to the soul, they need to serve word, prayer, and fellowship.) Different Posture From the list of nine, then, this leaves the three on which I want to focus in this session: generosity, service, and witness. These last three are different from the other six. Scripture and prayer are Godward and receptive; community is others-ward and first receptive, then also reciprocal. But these last three are first giving, not receiving; first pouring out, then receiving reward. In these three, we give of ourselves: We share the message of Christ, we give of our finances and possessions, and we give of our time, energy, and effort. “The words of witness give meaning to the acts of generosity and service.” So, let’s look at each of these three “habits of love” briefly. You could call these “Witness, Generosity, and Service”; or you could say, “Mission, Money, and Energy”; or you could say, “the Commission, the Dollar, and the Clock.” With each, I’ll turn to a few key texts of Scripture and ask a few questions to help us as we each consider applying and cultivating our “habits of love.” 1. The Commission: Jesus works through his disciples to make more disciples. There are at least two commissions from Jesus: You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. (Acts 1:8) All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (Matthew 28:18–20) So, two aspects of Jesus’s commission are witness and disciple-making. First, witness: Empowered by the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, we tell other people about Jesus and his gospel. We witness to what we ourselves have seen and heard and experienced in Jesus. We tell others about him with a view toward their embracing Jesus for themselves and being baptized into his church. But there’s another part to it in Matthew 28:20: “teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.” The mission doesn’t stop at conversion and baptism. What would Jesus’s disciples have understood when Jesus commissioned them to “make disciples”? He had called them in Matthew 4:19: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. Then, for three-plus years, he had invested himself in them, day by day, making them fishers of men. Disciple-making was not a one-time witness and baptism but an ongoing investment in their lives to form them into the kind of disciples who would make other disciples. So, here’s what I have in mind when I speak of disciple-making: The process in which a maturing believer invests himself, for a particular period of time, in one or just a few younger believers, in order to help them grow in the faith, including helping them also to invest in others who will invest in others. The apostle Paul captures this mission to one of his disciples in 2 Timothy 2:2: What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. Paul mentions four generations: Paul, Timothy, faithful men, others also. What does this have to do with witness and mission as “habits of love” through which we not only pour out but also benefit and receive? My short answer would be that witness and disciple-making are two-way streets. When you witness and when you invest in discipling others, you not only expend your own energy and heart and life, but you taste great joy in and because of the work. Paul gushed about the joy he received from his converts: What is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory and joy. (1 Thessalonians 2:19–20) So did the apostle John about the joy he received from his children in the faith, those in whom he had invested: I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. (3 John 4) Here are a few questions to ponder: Who in your life right now (at work, at home, a neighbor, a teammate) needs your witness or discipling? If it’s an unbeliever who needs to hear your witness and be invited to embrace Jesus, then here’s a first step: Pray for him or her. Pray that God would crack doors to witness. Pray that he would give you ideas for time together (in the right contexts), for asking the right questions, for their readiness to hear, and for your courage to go ahead and share even when the moment’s not perfect. If it’s a younger Christian, also begin with prayer. Consider how you might prioritize time together, and make plans to invest regularly in a younger brother or sister in the faith. So, first, we have the Commission: Jesus works through his disciples to make more disciples. 2. The Dollar: Jesus frees our fingers to give generously in his name. As we cultivate habits of grace, and our hearts are regularly fed and filled with God’s word and through prayer and in fellowship, we become the kind of people who want to give, like Christ himself has given. One expression of that is generosity: the giving of our possessions and finances. A heart full and happy in God gladly uses its money to show Christian love and to help others in Jesus’s name. Generosity is one of the great evidences of truly being a Christian and delighting in Jesus. “Freely you have received,” Jesus said; “freely give” (Matthew 10:8 NIV). The great reason for Christian generosity is that Christ himself gave. Second Corinthians 8:9: You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. Our giving to others is not payback for his giving himself for us. Rather, we give because his giving changes us, and he keeps on giving. And so, Paul summarizes Jesus’s teachings about giving like this in Acts 20:35: Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Generosity with our stuff and our dollars not only reveals our hearts but is a means of reward. Jesus doesn’t want us to give out of obligation or under compulsion. He wants us to give cheerfully, with our hearts full in him, and in pursuit of even greater, even richer, joy in him. So, Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 9:7: Each [Christian] must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. Not only does our God love a cheerful giver, but he himself is the great cheerful Giver. When we give cheerfully, we experience the increased joy of being like our Father in heaven and enjoying even more nearness to him. Here are some questions: How tight are your fingers with your finances? Do you know the joy of giving to others and trusting God to provide for you, and the reward of fellowship with him through giving sacrificially and cheerfully like him? Has God met your “needs of this life” and given you excess to share and give generously in Jesus’s name? How might he be calling you to sacrifice — not only giving comfortably from excess, but making some particular sacrifice of some possession you otherwise would enjoy, or finances you would use for something else, to go without that others may have? First, we have the Commission: Jesus works through his disciples to make more disciples. And then we have the Dollar: Jesus frees the fingers of his disciples to give generously and sacrificially in Jesus’s name. 3. The Clock: Jesus strengthens our hands to dedicate time, energy, and attention to serving others in his name. Your clock is even more precious than your dollar. Many of us in the modern world have an excess of money and possessions, but we all have the same number of hours each day as humans have always had. And we all have limited resources of energy, and we all live in 2025, when there is a war for our attention perhaps like never before. In Psalm 90:12, Moses prays, Teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. Paul writes in Ephesians 5:15–16: Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. We need wisdom for how we manage the clock, our schedules, to do others good. First, a word of warning about scheduling. James 4:13–15: Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit” — yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” We do not know what tomorrow will bring, much less next week or next month! So, as Christians, we steward our schedules with open hands. We don’t plan like the world does. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:19–20: Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. Brothers and sisters in Christ, we are not our own, and our time is not our own. We have been bought with a price — the precious blood of Jesus. So, glorify him in your schedule. What might that look like? Here are my closing questions: Are you more prone to be selfish with your time and attention, or careless? Are you more prone to over-schedule or under-schedule? What is your present calling in life? Not a calling that you aspire to in the future, but your calling right now. Think first and foremost about doing good for others in the scope of your calling. When you schedule your time, do you put the big stones in first? That is, what are the most important and typically most emotionally difficult parts of your calling? Put them in the jar first; then you can put the small pebbles around them. Prioritize the more difficult tasks that really move the needle in your calling and thus serve to bless and benefit others. Do you make the most of the morning? Not just the first morning, for time alone with God, but also the “second morning,” the beginning of the workday? Do you schedule in margin and flexibility for meeting the unplanned needs of others that arise? Do you have enough margin and flexibility in your calendar to meet late-breaking needs, to engage in unplanned conversations, or to share Jesus in unscheduled interactions, without dropping the major tasks of your calling? Pouring Out in Joy Brothers and sisters, you can’t pour out if you don’t fill up. And those who fill up want to pour out. And the pouring out of our finances, of our time, our attention, our energy, our very lives in disciple-making, are not only expressions of our joy in Jesus but also occasions for enriching our joy. When we pour out, our God never leaves us empty. He fills us up again, whether in the act of love itself or in the reward we receive in greater nearness to him.

What sustains happy, healthy followers of Christ? I’m passionate about these habits because meeting with God (alone every day and then with our church family) is the habit that has most dramatically changed my life. It really does touch every other thing I do. In my life, my devotions went on something of a journey from neglect, to discipline, to understanding (or at least the beginnings of understanding), to obedience, and finally to delight. That doesn’t mean I don’t struggle with neglect or confusion at times now — I certainly do. But I can honestly say that I look forward to my time alone with God. I love those minutes. I fight for those minutes. Because they’re no longer about doing what I have to do but what I want to do. I don’t know where you are on that journey — from neglect, to discipline, to understanding, to obedience, to delight — but my hope is that you leave tonight hungry for delight in your time alone with God. I hope you’ll be hungry to really enjoy him in secret, where no one’s watching or applauding you. Happy Is the Man Where do I see this secret delight in the Bible? (Because if you don’t see what I want for you in the Bible, you shouldn’t care what I want for you.) What gives me confidence that Bible reading should be more than just understanding and obedience? I see this delight in places like Psalm 1: Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. (Psalm 1:1–3) Blessed — happy — is the man who walks not in the ways of the wicked, sinners, scoffers, but who meditates on his law day and night. Why is he so happy? You could say it’s because life is going so well. “In all that he does, he prospers” — who wouldn’t be happy if everything was going that well? That might be part of the answer. You could also say it’s because he’s avoided the foolishness and misery of sinners. He’s not bearing the consequences they eventually reap for their persistent sin. That might be another part of the answer. I don’t think that’s the main reason this man’s so happy, though. No, I think the most important answer is right there in the verse: Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. This man is an unusually happy man because he finds his happiness in the words of God — who and how God has revealed himself to us. He delights in the Book. Do you? From Employment to Enjoyment I remember when I didn’t delight (and I’m not beyond those temptations and frustrations now). I was committed to reading the Bible every day. I had a bookmark where I could check off the three or four readings for each day. Sometimes I’d fall behind, but I’d race through chapters so that I could check every box. I wasn’t enjoying myself; I was proving myself. I knew that God was over my shoulder, waiting to see if I would wake up early enough, and give myself long enough, and pay close enough attention — or if I would start checking boxes I hadn’t actually read. When it came to my devotions, I was an employee, a slave. And then the God over my shoulder gently grabbed me by those shoulders and used (among other things) a paragraph in one of my favorite books. As John Piper writes in God Is the Gospel, Christ did not die to forgive sinners who go on treasuring anything above seeing and savoring God. And people who would be happy in heaven if Christ were not there, will not be there. The gospel is not a way to get people to heaven; it is a way to get people to God. (47, emphasis added) The gospel is a way to get people to God. The gospel is a way to get me to God. It was devastating at first. Devastating, because I knew I could be happy in heaven if Christ were not there. If he got me there, then I was good. And John Piper was saying that people who think about heaven like that won’t get to see heaven. It was devastating, but eventually thrilling. Because I realized that there was something to want about heaven better than everything I ever wanted about heaven before. I had stumbled into a land I’d never seen before, an ocean I’d never sailed before, a favorite meal I’d never tasted before. God wasn’t just the only way to get to heaven; he made heaven worth wanting. He was the great meal. He was the wild and wondrous ocean. He was the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great price. And that discovery about God changed everything about my time alone with God. He doesn’t just mean to be known and obeyed but enjoyed. He means to be savored and worshiped. And he’s not hard to enjoy. He’s the most complex, most satisfying, most thrilling wonder you or I will ever find. And he sets the table of wonder and satisfaction for us, day after day, right here in this Book. Invitation to Feast When I thought about spending thirty minutes with you tonight, my main desire was to tell you that your time alone with the Lord shouldn’t feel like a burden but a privilege, a blessing, a feast. And so, with the time left, I want to walk through a five-step prayer you could pray when you sit down with your Bible to meet with God. The five steps are built on an acronym for FEAST. F — Focus my mind. E — Enlighten my eyes. A — Address my sin. S — Satisfy my soul. T — Train my hands. F — Focus My Mind First, focus my mind. If you want to consistently enjoy Jesus in secret, this is where the fight really begins. I see this in the first verses of Psalm 1: “His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night” (Psalm 1:2). No one meditates on anything without focus. That means we can’t access the blessedness of Psalm 1:1 unless we find the focus of verse 2 — unless God gives us the gift of keeping everything else at bay long enough to hear his voice. We won’t see or hear anything meaningful in our Bible reading if we’re not able to focus. And many of us aren’t able to focus. We might choose a Bible reading plan, and open the Bible every morning, and run our eyes over verses and chapters, but we’re not really reading the Bible. We’re certainly not meeting with God. We’re over our Bibles, but we’re actually meeting with our to-do list for the day, or that hard conversation from yesterday, or the game that’s happening that night, or the social media posts we scrolled through that morning. Our eyes might be here, but our minds and hearts are everywhere else. And so, we pray, “God, as I sit down to see you, hear from you, and enjoy you, focus my mind.” We pray Psalm 119:37: “Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways.” Why would anyone ever have to pray that? Why would anyone waste time looking at worthless things when they could be seeing God, hearing from God, and enjoying God? Why do we do that? Because Satan has a thousand ways of making worthless things seem more compelling and urgent than meeting with the God of the universe. Do you know that you’re under attack when you sit down to meet with God? Pray and ask God for the mighty gift of focus. E — Enlighten My Eyes Second, enlighten my eyes. “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law” (Psalm 119:18). We need focus when we sit down to meet with God, but we also need light. We need God, by the power of his Spirit, to help us understand his word. My favorite verse for this prayer is 2 Timothy 2:7: “Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.” This is an amazing acknowledgment when you stop to think about it. He says, in essence, “I know some of what I am writing won’t make sense to you immediately, and you’ll be tempted to think you can’t understand it — but you can. So, don’t give up too easily. Don’t assume this is above you. Assume that the God who raised you from the dead can make his words clear to you.” “Your time alone with the Lord shouldn’t feel like a burden but a privilege, a blessing, a feast.” Those apart from Christ cannot understand the things of God. They flip through the Bible’s majesty and wisdom in vain. “The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14). But not you. If you’re in Christ, you can see things that they can’t. You can understand things that they can’t. Where they see foolishness and irrelevance, you see unspeakable beauty, a stunning window into reality. It’s not because you’re smarter or more educated or merely a better reader. It’s because you’re not a natural person anymore; you’re a supernatural you with a supernatural mind and heart and eyes. God “has shone in [your heart] to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). That’s who you are when you open the Bible. And because you’re someone new, you can understand more of the Bible than you might think. Not only can you understand more than you think, but the apostle goes even further: “The Lord will give you understanding in everything.” With God’s help, nothing in this book is too hard for you. Now, to say that we can understand everything in the Bible is not to suggest that we will understand everything immediately and fully. We won’t — and certainly not on the first (or second or even tenth) time through. Some questions will be answered slowly. So, don’t expect to understand everything now, but do expect to understand something now — and more tomorrow, and more the next day. This understanding, however, doesn’t float down from the clouds and land softly on our heads. No, God gives the gift of understanding through the hard work of thinking and reading well. This verse demands almost as much as it promises: “Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.” This won’t come easily, Timothy. Yes, God is the one who gives understanding, but that doesn’t mean you won’t have to work for it. So, when we sit down, and the Lord gives us focus, we pray, “Enlighten my eyes.” “Make me understand the way of your precepts, and I will meditate on your wondrous works” (Psalm 119:27). A — Address My Sin Third, address my sin. Now, I could have said absolve (forgive) my sin — that’s a good A-word. Or I could have said abolish (conquer) my sin. Address allows me to say both, though, just like King David does in Psalm 51: Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! (Psalm 51:1–2) In other words, forgive my sin. Micah 7:18–19 says, Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love. . . . You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. But when David sinned against Bathsheba, Uriah, and God (that’s the context of this prayer of confession in Psalm 51), he wasn’t content with just forgiveness. He wanted God to do more than forgive when it came to his sin. Psalm 51:10 says, Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. When I ask you, O God, to address my sin, I don’t want you to just forgive my sin; I want you to rid me of sin. For me, I don’t want to wallow in self-pity like I do when I disappoint my wife — when I don’t do something I said I was going to do, or when I communicate badly in a busy season, or when I don’t step up and lead in a difficult situation. I can’t kill those sins of self-pity, passivity, or selfishness without God’s help. We put sin to death by the Spirit (Romans 8:13). And so, we turn Jesus’s prayer for us in John 17:17 into our own prayer for ourselves: “Sanctify [me] in the truth; your word is truth.” We pray, “Address my sin. Forgive me, yes, but change me. Empower me to overcome temptation.” We also pray for God to use his word to show us our sin. Address the sins I’m aware of and address the ones I’m not. “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!” (Psalm 139:23–24). When I open my Bible each morning, and I’ve stared at Jesus there for another ten, or thirty, or sixty minutes, I sure hope I leave a little more like him. We pray, “God, address my sin.” S — Satisfy My Soul The fourth prayer is the entrée. The “S” is the whole FEAST in just three words: Satisfy my soul. Psalm 90:14 says, “Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.” Do you ever pray like that when you sit down to meet with God: “Satisfy me again this morning”? This is my main burden for you this evening, when I think about your time alone with the Lord. You’ve probably prayed for God to help you understand the Bible, and you’ve probably prayed for God to forgive you and sanctify you. You may have even prayed for God to help you focus when you read the Bible. I would bet, though, that fewer of you sit down with your Bible and expect God to delight you — to captivate and really move you. You expect that delight when you sit down to your favorite meal. No one has to tell you to pay attention and enjoy yourself when the barbecue comes. But, if you’re honest, the Bible doesn’t feel like a favorite meal; it might not feel like a meal at all. It might feel like a chore. Yet I really believe this is better than your favorite meal. I believe that if God gives you focus and understanding, and removes your sin, these can be the most satisfying moments of your day. Psalm 119 agrees with me. Listen to how he talks about the Bible, about Scripture: “In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches” (Psalm 119:14). “Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart” (Psalm 119:111). “I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil” (Psalm 119:162). Could you pray like that? If not, don’t you want to be able to pray like that? We have to compel our kids to clean their rooms — “You’ll get a spanking if you don’t clean your room,” or, “No dessert if you don’t clean your room,” or, “We’ll get rid of some toys if you leave them lying around.” We never have to compel our kids to go to Chick-fil-A. If they hear a phrase that remotely sounds like Chick-fil-A, they’re already in the van, seatbelts and smiles on, ready to go. Does your Bible reading look more like picking up laundry and LEGOs or like “Eat mor chikin”? “Assume that the God who raised you from the dead can make his words clear to you.” In Psalm 16:11, David says, “You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.” You can’t do better than that. YouTube can’t do better than that. Instagram can’t do better than that. The best, most productive days at work or in the home can’t do better than that. You don’t get full and forever anywhere but him — but you get him fullest and clearest right here. We pray, “Lord, satisfy our souls with yourself.” T — Train My Hands Finally, train my hands. I’m not going to spend much time here, because this is where David is going with the next session, but it belongs in the acronym. We need a prayer for this. We don’t ever want to be mere hearers, or even enjoyers, of this word. We also want to be doers of the word. James 1:22–25 says, Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing. He will be blessed — happy — in his doing. “This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept your precepts” (Psalm 119:56). God-given, Spirit-filled obedience is essential to enjoying Jesus in secret. So, we pray, “Lord, train my hands to obey you and glorify you in everything you’ve called me to do.” As we pray for God to do something for us and in us in our time with him, we also want him to do something through us for others. Again, David is going to go here next, and he will focus on how a life of this kind of communion with God in his word spills over into the needs of others. But before we do, I want to briefly add one dimension here. Enjoying Jesus in Community This talk was titled “Enjoying Jesus in Secret,” but a life of spiritual feasting is never only in secret. No, with the word and prayer, we need one another. We need word, prayer, and fellowship in the local church. To survive and enjoy the Christian life, you absolutely need to meet with God alone in secret — and you absolutely need to meet regularly with others who can help you see, savor, and follow Jesus. Positively, Hebrews 10:24–25 says, Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near. God doesn’t just use the word and prayer to stir us up for love and good works — he uses people. Who are those people for you? Maybe they’re here with you tonight. Whoever those people are, God wants us to be intentional and creative in how we encourage one another and stir each other up to love. “Let us consider.” Negatively, a few chapters earlier, Hebrews 3:12–13 warns, Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. So, positively, we encourage and stir one another up. Negatively, we keep each other from being captured and hardened by temptation. Why do Christians, from the early church to today, in every time and place, gather? In part, because we need to see and enjoy God, and we know how little we can see by ourselves. We want to take in and experience more of Jesus than we would ever see on our own. Tim Keller writes, quoting C.S. Lewis, By praying with friends, you will be able to hear and see facets of Jesus that you have not yet perceived. . . . That way “the more we share the Heavenly Bread between us, the more we shall all have.” (Prayer, 119) In other words, when we enjoy Jesus together, we each get to have more of him — because we get to enjoy what others see in him. If you’re here tonight and you’re committed to a local church like that, I’m so happy for you. You can’t measure how much your ongoing community is helping you enjoy Jesus, but they are helping. Your time alone with God is different and better because you’re a meaningful part of his body. And if you’re not yet in a church, joining one is an essential step to knowing and enjoying Jesus. If you really want to enjoy the feast, commit yourself to a particular local church where you can be known, encouraged, challenged, and loved.

Ephesians 1:3–14 is one of the most concentrated, exalted, and weighty descriptions of God’s purpose in the universe from eternity to eternity. It’s the kind of writing that stretches the mind to the limits of comprehension. It takes us back before the creation of the universe into the personal consciousness of absolute reality, God himself, and beckons us to understand the unfathomable good pleasure, will, purpose, counsel, and plan of God, as they were formulated in the infinite mind of God. We are invited to enter that mind and understand. It takes us forward to an everlasting inheritance. And it takes us to the center of the whole creation, where the most-loved Son of God shed his blood for the redemption of a people predestined to be the happy, praising family of God forever. The sweep is vast. The heights are breathtaking. The implications pervade all of life. The realities that Paul is describing in Ephesians 1:3–14 are ten thousand times more significant, more important, more amazing, and more relevant to your life than anything that happens in Washington, D.C., or on any of the news feeds that you consult every day. Compared to the realities of Ephesians 1:3–14, those things are as nothing. Doctrine and Prayer When Paul is done writing this most exalted portion of Scripture, what does he do? He prays. He prays for us in Ephesians 1:15–23; the rest of the chapter is a prayer. What will he ask God to do after such a mind-bending paragraph? He’s going to pray a second time in Ephesians 3:14–21 (one of the most beautiful prayers in the Bible) after another weighty, glorious depiction of our salvation in chapter 2. So, the pattern of the first half of Ephesians is this: theology, prayer, theology, prayer — doctrine, prayer, doctrine, prayer. What is he asking for? In neither prayer is he asking God to help us do anything. Doing comes later. These prayers are further upstream from behavior. Behavior comes in chapters 4–6. What does he pray for? Start at Ephesians 1:16–17: I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him. Paul has just unleashed an avalanche of knowledge about God in verses 3–14. And now he’s praying, “O God, grant that the Ephesians and the folks at TGC would be able to grasp, and receive, and treasure, and be formed by the knowledge of yourself that I have just given in verses 3–14. Grant that your Spirit would shape their spirits so that the contours of the revelation I have just given would fit.” Because, if your heart has a round hole and the knowledge of God is a square peg, not only will it not fit, but it will be very uncomfortable, and you may get angry. He continues to pray in Ephesians 1:18–19: Having the eyes of your hearts enlightened . . . This is huge. Everybody in this room has eyes in their heads. And everybody in this room has eyes in their hearts. And those heart-eyes are either darkened so that you can’t truly know the reality of verses 3–14, or they are enlightened so that you can. That’s what Paul and I are praying for. Now he mentions three specifics he prays they will truly know: . . . that you may know [1] what is the hope to which he has called you, [2] what are the riches of [the glory of his] inheritance in the saints, and [3] what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe. The hopefulness of your calling. The riches of your eternal inheritance. The greatness of the power that has raised you from the dead and seated you at God’s right hand with Christ. The roots of that hopefulness, those riches, and that power are in the theology, the doctrine, of Ephesians 1:3–14. But we will not know them as they ought to be known unless the Spirit of God cuts away the blinding cataracts of the eyes of our hearts. And that’s why this great soul doctor follows his doctrine with prayer. Now, let’s pray for this encounter with Ephesians 1:3–14. Father, please give to us a spirit of wisdom and of revelation to know you. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts. Take away the blindness. And grant that we would see, and know, and love, and be formed by the truth of this book of Ephesians in this conference. In Jesus’s name I pray. Amen. Unconditional Grace What is Paul’s main point in Ephesians 1:3–14? That is, what is the point that everything else is serving, everything else is clarifying, everything else is supporting or defending or guaranteeing? I don’t think it’s hard to see the answer to that question, because Paul states it three times. And he states it in a way that it is plainly a goal, not a means to a goal. Look at the beginning of verse 6: “to the praise of [the glory of his] grace.” The goal is the praise of the glory of God’s grace. Then look at verse 12, at the end: “to the praise of his glory.” The goal is the praise of God’s glory. Then look at the end of verse 14, “to the praise of his glory.” The goal is the praise of the glory of God, most specifically the glory of his grace (Ephesians 1:6) — the beauty, worth, greatness, and freedom of his grace. Everything in this paragraph serves to show that the glory of God is worthy of your praise, especially the glory of his grace. So, let’s look at two of these three places and see what it is that gives rise to the praise of the glory of God’s grace. Let’s look first at Ephesians 1:4–6: He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of [the glory of his] grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. One of the reasons Paul traces God’s saving grace back before the creation of the universe into the eternal mind of God is to establish the nature of that grace. Its nature is that it is, first, unconditional. The grace of your being chosen, and your holiness, and your predestination, and your adoption as God’s child is traced back before your existence, so that it would be plain that it was owing to nothing in us, since we didn’t exist. Before you existed, he chose you out of an unholy humanity to be holy. Before you existed, he predestined you — assigned your destiny. You will be his child. And the point of stressing that you did not yet exist is to make the nature of saving grace glorious and praiseworthy — namely, it is not based on anything in you at all. You didn’t exist. But Paul wants to make it even clearer. So, at the end of verse 5, he adds two amazing words. He takes us beneath election and beneath predestination and speaks of their roots. Where did God’s choice of you come from? What moved him to set his gracious, saving favor on you? Why you? Paul answers with two words: His choice and his predestination are “according to the purpose of his will.” How did God decide on you? Where does his choice come from? He could have simply answered, “My choice is according to my will. My will, and nothing else, is the bottom line for whom I choose to save.” As he says in Romans 9:15–16, “‘I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.’ So then it depends not on human [willing] or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.” “Your election is owing entirely, freely, gloriously to God’s good pleasure, and not to anything in you.” So, Paul could have just said, “I am underlining the freedom — the unconditionality — of God’s saving grace by saying, at the end of verse 5, ‘it accords with God’s will.’” But he doesn’t just say that. He says, “The grace of God’s choice of you, and the grace of God’s predestination of you, is ‘according to the purpose of his will,’ or the ‘good pleasure [eudokia] of his will.’” This is almost unfathomable, that Paul would take us beneath God’s choice to its ground in God’s will, and then, as if to go deeper, to the ground of his will — from choice, down to will, down to good pleasure. Why is he doing this? He’s doing it to help us see how absolutely free and unconditional and glorious and praiseworthy grace is. The glory of God’s saving grace consists in large measure in its freedom — freedom from depending on anything in us. Self-Determination or Sovereign Grace? He is talking this way to keep you from believing that you were chosen on the basis of your foreknown faith. Millions of people have been taught that Christians were not chosen on the basis of the good pleasure of the will of God in unconditional grace. Instead, they have been taught that God looked into the future and foresaw human beings exercising ultimate self-determination in becoming believers. And thus, what God’s choice means is that God chose beforehand to save anybody and everybody who meets the condition — that is, who uses their ultimate self-determination at the point of conversion to believe. When you look back at the point of your conversion to Christ, when you consider the precise moment when you passed from death to life, from outside Christ to in Christ where there’s no condemnation, from unsaved to saved — was self-determination decisive at that moment? Or was the free, unconditional, mighty grace of God decisive at that moment? If you say, “I was decisive at that moment. My free will, my self-determination, not God, was decisive when I passed from death to life, from unbelief to belief” — if you believe that, my response to you at this point in the message would be this: Paul has labored in choosing his words very carefully in Ephesians 1:4–5 to keep you from thinking that way, to keep you from diminishing the praise of the glory of God’s grace. First Corinthians 1:30 says, “Because of [God] you are in Christ Jesus.” Tonight, we will hear from Ephesians 2 that God made us alive when we were dead. God gave us faith. As Acts 13:48 says, “As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.” It’s not the other way around. And he’s not done clarifying the glory of God’s saving grace as free and unconditional. So, let’s go to verses 11–12, where we get the second reference: “to the praise of [the] glory [of God].” Chosen Heirs Ephesians 1:11–12 says, In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose [prothesin] of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. So, what is it that leads to the praise of his glory? In verse 11, Paul roots the certainty of our future inheritance in the fact that we were predestined for it. “In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined . . .” Again, Paul has taken us back before creation to predestination as the ground of our hope that we will gain a great inheritance in Christ. But, just like in verse 5, he does more. Again, he pushes beneath predestination to God’s “purpose” in verse 11: “. . . predestined according to the purpose of him . . .” God’s predestining us was rooted in a purpose, a design, a plan. And then, as if to make crystal clear that this purpose is not to restrain his sovereignty and see how humans will use their ultimate self-determination, he says, “. . . the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will” (Ephesians 1:11). Just as in verse 5 he spoke of the “[good pleasure] of his will,” so here he speaks of “the counsel of his will” — both phrases designed to shout, “Your election, your predestination, your adoption, your inheritance, are owing entirely, freely, gloriously to God’s purpose, God’s will, God’s good pleasure, God’s counsel in eternity, and not to anything in you!” What you bring is sin and deadness and hardness. What he brings is grace. And if we ask, “Paul, should we even believe, trust, receive, pray, and obey?” he answers, “Indeed you will; you must. And when you have believed, you will turn and look at the miracle and say with the words of verse 11 that he has done it.” He has “[worked] all things according to the counsel of his will” — including my faith. He planned it all. He worked it all to the praise of the glory of his grace. Do you remember what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:10? “I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.” Of course, we believe, we receive, we trust, we treasure, we pray, we obey, we love, we work, we die for this reality. And when we come to the end, we say, “It was not I, but the grace of God.” We praise the glory of the grace of God, not ourselves. So, we have seen in Ephesians 1:4–6 that God chose us and predestined us for adoption unconditionally “[unto] the praise of [the glory of his] grace.” And we have seen in Ephesians 1:11–12 that we may be confident in this predestination because God not only plans all things according to the good pleasure of his will, but he also works all things according to the counsel of his will — all of it to the praise of his glory, especially the glory of his grace. To the Praise of Jesus Christ Between these two texts (verses 4–6 and verses 11–12) that take the glory of God’s grace back into the eternal good pleasure of God, Paul lifts up Jesus Christ, the infinitely loved Son of God. And he says that everything God was aiming at in choosing us for holiness, and predestining us for adoption, and obtaining our inheritance, Jesus Christ has purchased by the shedding of his blood for the forgiveness of our sins — and this too is owing entirely to the glory of grace. Verse 7 says, “In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.” Trespasses. Blood. Forgiveness. Where did this come from? Suddenly, a whole world of sin is before us, which means God did not choose holy people. He chose wicked people to become holy. He chose treasonous people, hell-deserving people. So, in the plan and good pleasure and counsel of his will was the blood of the Beloved — from eternity. The book of life where the names of the chosen are written before the foundation of the world has a name. In Revelation 13:8, John calls it “the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.” The slaughter of the perfect Lamb of God was predestined so that predestined wicked people (you and me) could be redeemed. And it was also so that, according to Ephesians 1:10, God might “unite [or sum up] all things in [Christ].” We were chosen in him (verse 4). We were predestined through him (verse 5). We have redemption in him (verse 7). We have our inheritance secured in him (verse 11). We are sealed in him (verse 13). And so, we hope in him (verse 12). From eternal election to eternal inheritance, all the gracious purposes of God are through Christ and for Christ. He is the embodiment of the glory of the grace of God. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). When we say that the main point of Ephesians 1 is “the praise of the glory of the grace of God,” we mean the praise of the glory of Jesus Christ. More Than Words Here’s one last application to your heart, and mine. The goal of the universe is praise — the praise of the glory of the grace of God. What is praise? It is not mere words. I requested from ChatGPT, “Please compose a thirty-second prayer to God in the spirit and theology of D.A. Carson, in praise to the glory of God’s grace.” In three seconds, it gave me this: Gracious Father, we bow before you, the Sovereign Lord of history and redemption. From eternity past, you purposed to lavish grace upon undeserving sinners through the blood of your beloved Son. We praise you for the glory of your mercy, unearned and unmeasured, made manifest in Christ crucified and risen. May our lives, redeemed and sanctified by your Spirit, be vessels of praise to the riches of your grace. To you be glory forever. Amen. Is that praise? It is not. Jesus said, “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me” (Matthew 15:8–9). If there is no heartfelt loving, treasuring, embracing, enjoying, delighting, or being satisfied in the glory of the unconditional, choosing, predestining, redeeming grace of God, we are not praising. Computers will never have Spirit-given joy in the glory of the grace of God. It is the Spirit-given feeling of the worth and beauty and greatness of the grace of God for which you and the universe were made. If that is not your portion, give yourself no rest until it is. You were made to praise — that is, you were made to feel — the preciousness of grace, and to speak it and show it.
